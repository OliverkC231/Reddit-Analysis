In short; just a lot of emotionally stunted people who don't know how to deal with the discomfort of watching the human experience of the end of a life happen.

The fact we still have %80 of the detail we used to is a monument to modern manufacturing.

MildlyInfuriating,Hot wheels losing details over the years,1gpm0yi,lwsu222,"Ok this is going to get buried with how many replies are already in here, however having been a collector of these cars for going on 30 years, some insights...

Your ***basic*** Hot Wheels line of cars have been at a ~$1 USD price point for *years.* Like, probably 40 years now. $1 nowadays has less buying power than it did 10, 20, 30 years ago. To allow the ***basic*** line to remain at that price point, some things has to be sacrificed over time. That's why we've been getting fewer and fewer *basic* releases that are metal/metal (meaning metal body and metal base). There's been multiple things that have had to be sacrificed as the years have gone on. You won't find 3-axle cars in the mainline anymore. More and more original, unlicensed designs are popping into the mainline to help offset licensing costs and keep the average price for the mainline at that $1 USD price point. Castings nowadays, for the basic line, are primarily required to be no more than 4 pieces excluding wheel/axle barbells. So that typically means body, window, interior and base. Add in that they need to be designed to be a drop-in-place assembly for ease of quick assembly. They've also had to start adding a lot more legalese text to the bases of these things, so that's part of why the lack of details especially in the center of the base. Plus as many others have noted, a lot of these modern sports cars usually have aero pieces on the underbody that hide a lot of details. To add these usually are limited in the number of surfaces that can get deco on each release.

Now beyond the basic line, there are more premium lines that cost more (nowadays known as Silver Label and Gold Label). These will typically not have original designs, so that adds to the overall cost. Silver Label will usually have a mix of basic and more premium toolings, and have some sort of licensing costs across the entire line. So that makes those a bit more expensive than the basic line, usually 2-3x more. Then you have the Gold Label lines. These will all be fully licensed in casting, deco or both; have the 2-piece Real Rider wheels; and a deco process to get full details on every surface of the castings (that process has left some to be desired lately but that's another story). These will also be all metal/metal, and toolings designed initially to be used here will often have more than the 4 part limit, and don't necessarily have to be all drop-in-plade assemblies. Retail costs for Gold Label are about 5-6x more than basic. 

There is a lot more to it for modern times than I feel like getting into, but this is the gist of it all currently for retail releases.",doomus_rlc,6,2024-11-12 19:56:45

I couldn’t find anything about this “last-minute” policy in your syllabus or the school’s handbook. Can you point me to where I can find more information about this policy?”

Edit: To clarify those who think this is a dumb plan. The point of this is not to keep being nice or because the student is wrong, they are obviously right. This is a thinly veiled threat and the professor will see it as such. It is pointing out to the professor that they have no leg to stand on and show that you are asking them to document this before you escalate further. It’s a power play but without immediately involving the Dean which will avoid the professor feeling the need to retaliate against you for publicly embarrassing them. I’m not saying going straight to the Dean wouldn’t work but this would likely result in a more comfortable rest of the semester (which likely just started if this is the US).",Androgynous-Rex,342,2023-02-04 03:16:04

MildlyInfuriating,My dad does this to avoid cutting pepperoni,1375ixw,jisfhla,"Southern Italian here. 
This is more than mildly infuriating. 

If he hates to cut stuff then fold the whole pizza in 4, wrap the half bottom (kinda like what you would do with kebab) with paper and eat it like that. We do it a lot in Naples with streetfood pizza, it’s called “pizza a portafoglio” which means “wallet pizza” because the pizza is folded like a leather wallet and the pizza topping becomes money in this visual metaphor. 

Also the word “pepperoni” is totally confusing for Italians, you use it because “pepper” as in the spice, but in Italian “Peperoni” means “Bell Pepper” so when we have a “Pizza ai peperoni” here is pizza with stripes of red and/or yellow bell pepper on top; so you call a pizza in an almost correct Italian wording but the stuff on top is “salame” instead of “Peperoni”. It was the one thing we hated the most about Pizza abroad before pinap*** pizza became a thing, I’m using asterisks because even pronouncing that pizza’s name is a sin.",axior,7,2023-05-04 03:46:21

MildlyInfuriating,My dad does this to avoid cutting pepperoni,1375ixw,jisv196,"A good tip if you don't wanna worry about cutting the pepperonis is to cook them separately, just on a sheet pan in the oven at 450°F for  3-5 minutes. After you cut your pizza, just place the cooked pepperonis on the slices, preferably when the cheese on the pizza is still hot and melty fresh from the oven. The pepperonis will be crispy, and your dad can have a uniform pizza.

If your ONLY use of a printer is to print black and white documents then just go out and buy a thermal printer. It works off the same principle as a receipt printer where it has a heating element to apply heat and ""print"" on thermal paper.

Thermal printers cost roughly $60 to $90 and don't use ink. You just have to buy thermal paper for them to print on which costs a little more than normal paper.",Ruraraid,6,2025-01-19 19:54:37

Dude said no, that until he got some sort of written proof from the lawyer himself that he'd been asked to stop, the faxes would continue.

MildlyInfuriating,I put up a fence to keep my thieving and incredibly nosy neighbor out. He then puts up a camera so that he can look in.,vz1eyv,ig5yl2p,"Long term, I would address it in this order:

1. Check your local laws/ordinances. Having a camera aimed specifically into someone else's yard is not legal in some places, and you could possibly take action that way. Talk to police or local town code enforcement. Discuss with a lawyer if possible. If it is illegal or considered harassment, a strongly worded cease and desist letter may do the trick. See if they can possibly be fined (usually increasing fines if it isn't taken care of).
2. Install a privacy screen that is several feet taller than your fence (or attaches to the top of your fence) right where the camera is, to block the view ([an idea for what that's like](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/6f/1e/156f1e5183cec7ea7ca70b3f9f49dd8b.jpg)), or a trellis where you can grow vines attached to the top of the fence line on that side. Check that you will not be in violation of town codes first.
3. Consider tall privacy plantings along that fence that will grow to be several feet taller than the fence, blocking the view. ([Example](https://gardengoodsdirect.com/products/arborvitae-emerald-green?variant=22670038171712&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=pmax+big+3+small+sizes&utm_content=&utm_term=&device=c&gclid=CjwKCAjw_b6WBhAQEiwAp4HyIEYW2erYRfAd9wUKfBH-QmsbxSr5dB0T-HIcKywlu1f6J-PiNdbQxRoCq8gQAvD_BwE)) Thick tall border trees are likely the best solution, but not cheap and they'll take time to fill in.",T00narmy1,18,2022-07-14 19:07:00

MildlyInfuriating,Son’s math test,1gq3j2j,lwv2xh0,"When school becomes more about guessing the expected answer than about reasoning; what a disaster.

EDIT (I had no idea this would be so controversial, lol)

Some might argue this shouldn’t apply to elementary school kids, but there’s no age too young or too old to develop logical and critical thinking. We’re not training lab rats! Acknowledging a kid for following the teacher’s method and acknowledging a kid for finding the same answer in a different way are not mutually exclusive.

Mathematics isn’t just about following a specific method: it’s about thinking logically and efficiently. As long as a student can explain their reasoning and get the right answer, the method doesn’t matter as much.

That’s why many great mathematicians were also philosophers: Pythagoras, Descartes, Pascal, Kant, Kierkegaard.

When we force kids to stick to rigid methods, we can frustrate them and make them focus more on guessing the “right” way rather than understanding the problem.

Anyway, thank you for attending my Ted Talk 😆

EDIT 2 Please read the teacher’s instructions carefully!

The questions specifically asks for “an addition equation that matches the multiplication equation”, which implies that the focus is on the mathematical relationship between the numbers, not on any specific set or context (like apples and baskets).

Since multiplication can be read both ways when there is no specific grouping (or set), both answers are valid.

If the teacher had something else in mind, s/he missed the opportunity to clarify the exercise and ensure that students understood that multiplication can be interpreted different ways depending on the context and s/he should have specified the sets, like per example:

3 apples x 4 baskets = 12 apples

Also, don’t assume that 2nd graders can’t understand the difference.",None,8248,2024-11-13 03:37:09

the question, though, clearly states it could be any ol' addition equation transposed from 3*4=12.

id definitely contact the teacher.  maybe she had a brain fart.

*edit:  i just wanted to add, the kid is clearly correct.  both of these being the same is an extremely basic concept of algebra.*

*i also think its a good idea to practice critical thinking, even in algebraic math, and the exercise of breaking down this equation as almost a sentence or language has value.  to say what is the *most accurate* version of this in addition.*

*however, learning that this stuff is interchangeable and doesnt matter from a technical standpoint is imperative because you will have to learn to be pretty flexible once you start doing more wild algebra.  i think this has WAY more value than the concept listed above*

MildlyInfuriating,Son’s math test,1gq3j2j,lwv23an,"Looks like the question above clearly has a 4x3 multiplication written as 3+3+3+3 = 12  
This is because 4x3 means four copies of three, under the conventions established by this classroom.

4x3 = Four groups of three.

They wanted you to write 3x4 as 4+4+4 so that you understand that this represents a different idea.  
3x4 = Three groups of four.

I believe most students this age find it apparent that 3x4 = 4x3. This is because multiplication is commutative. But the goal of the lesson wasn't to demonstrate that, rather show you understand the nuance of the order.

It's more than likely the student got marked incorrectly because the teacher sees them as just copying the previous answer, and not understanding the lesson about how the two permutations of the multiplication technically mean different things, even if they both result in the same answer.

However, this is obviously dumb, because the test itself doesn't make that clear to the students, by using vague language, and then destroys self-confidence when they get penalized for doing something that, in all other contexts, would be absolutely correct.",FettuccineInMe,170,2024-11-13 03:31:41

3 X 4 = 12. For the purpose of your elementary school math question, the multiplication symbol is replaced with the ""groups of"". 

You have 12 students, place the students in 3 groups of 4. Therefore, the addition statement is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. 

That addition statement, is going to be different that placing those students in 4 groups of 3. Which would be 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12. 

So while 3 groups of 4 and 4 groups of 3 are both separating 12 students. How you group 12 is different. There are always 12 students but the grouping are different. 

You're not being asked if 4 groups of 3 and 3 groups of 4 are equal to 12 students - you're being asked how you would divide them into groups based on the 3 [groups of] 4 = 12.",Cotsy8,13,2024-11-13 12:40:16

MildlyInfuriating,Baked potato chips came out looking like used condoms,1jb0oa2,mhx0erd,"Did you simply slice these and bake them?

If so, there are multiple steps to take in order to get them crispy. By just throwing them in like that, the moisture from the potatoes will just come out and making it soggy.

First soak the slices in cold water for at least 20 minutes. This brings out the starch and allows them to become crunchy. I always add vinegar to my water, I for the life of me cannot remember why, but I know it does something. 

Dry them off properly with paper towel, then let them air dry even further. Additionally you could toss them in a bit of flour or corn starch to absorb any remaining moisture, but you need to be sure to really shake off the excess. 

From there you should be good to bake them. To avoid burning if bake em at 375-400 for about 10 mins, then flip and bake another 5-10 checking on them until they start to turn golden. 

I've never made baked chips, but I have fried them before.

Edit: don't overlap the potatoes either, they won't bake evenly and it won't come out good.",None,3,2025-03-15 13:21:25

Slimey little hotel refused to let me off the reservation, wouldn't refund the stay so I ended up having to do a charge back for the first time. 

Hotel straight up LIED and said I actually stayed the night.  LOL..  then how come I used that same credit card to check into another hotel 1 hour later?   That's what the customer service rep told me she asked.  She said they were VERY salty about the whole thing. 
Luckily I was Ok with wasting one shot of my precious film (before digital cameras) and took a picture.   

The credit card company sided with me and Within a few hours of winning the chargeback war,   I started getting hangs up and a weird mouth breather guy - 10x or more a day.  Can't prove it, but it was them.

Your ability to push back and defend yourself is likely rare in this situation and they won't learn unless you present your counter evidence to the authorities. 

They may decide it is nothing, but allowing them to have information for an investigation and/or future complaints will only help the consumers in this situation.

MildlyInfuriating,Hotel owner who threatened to keep my deposit because I left bad review threatened me with the police.,uva27i,i9kea5g,"I'm pretty sure this is fake. 

If you follow the logic and the conversation between both posts.

What hotel holds a $20 deposit? A deposit is usually a lot more than that. $100 or more. What is a hotel going to fix with $20?

How would the hotel owner have seen a reddit post about their hotel? They could have been sent a link, but we don't see that.

Why would they threaten to call the police? It makes literally no sense. Call them and tell them what, exactly?

Think about it. A person who has gone their entire life and apparently owns a hotel is now all of the sudden stupid enough to threaten somebody over a supposed $20 deposit and then threatens to call the police?

That sounds like a crazy person. Crazy people like that don't own businesses.

This gives me choosingbeggars vibes. Like fake texts. Scripted. All follow the same karma farming schematic.

We booked a hotel for 3 nights.  After the first night, my wife didn't feel safe as none of the locking doors actually locked and the entire place gave off ""drug hotel"" vibes.

So, we cancelled our next two nights and I left a bad review online.  I was then contacted saying they refused to cancel our two nights (they already had) and they were going to charge us for damage to the room that our kids caused (there was no damage and our kids basically slept the entire time as it was a long day).

I took screenshots of the entire conversation and contacted their headquarters.  I informed her I was doing so, and she deleted all her messages.  I had already took screenshots.

We were given an apology, the first night we stayed was free, and the cancelled the rest with no issues.

MildlyInfuriating,My mom burned all my drawings,1iqe1e5,mczgepd,"Hey OP, my parents did a similar thing when I was a teen because they saw my art as ‘a waste of time’. I stopped drawing traditionally for about 15 years, but now I make hundreds of dollars off a single artwork and am working towards being a fully self employed artist.

Don’t let this stop you, it’s just one hurdle on the way to becoming a master artist. If you have a phone or tablet, you could download a free drawing app to draw on there too so that your artworks can’t be destroyed.

Edit: since so many are seeing this and sharing their own stories- it’s never too late to get back into art, and it’s never been easier or more accessible. There are a lot of free tutorials for just about anything you want online.

I’m going to throw this out there to check out the Art Mentor on YouTube. He’s got a lot of great advice from getting started to growing a business as an artist.

Marc Brunet, Winged Canvas, laovaan, draw like a sir, Sam does art are all also great YouTubers I can think of off the top of my head

This is a hold, possibly due to some sort of fraud (be it check, ACH, wire, etc). This is to prevent you from taking anything from out of the acc. 9 is the default number for these. 

Chances are customer service will NOT tell you what’s going on with your account. If it’s a lien or garnishment they’ll give you a number for the company that placed the garnishment against you. If it’s not that, chances are you’ll get a cashier’s check sent to your address on file for the amount of any remaining funds and then your account will be shut down and you’ll be barred from ever banking there again. You’ll also probably get a mark on your ChexSystems record that will make opening a new acc more difficult.

ETA: getting a check for any remaining funds can take MONTHS. It’s in a bank’s contract that we can hold your funds for however long we please. There is no time frame for your account closure, or receiving your funds back.

MildlyInfuriating,Eating in public as a celebrity,p5eop0,h9610x7,"Not being sexist - but why is it mostly women who do this kind of stuff to celebrities?  Like, men take pictures as paparazzi, but that’s because there’s a solid financial incentive.  There are tens of millions of young American women who would literally just follow their favorite singer or actor as he’s walks about town doing mundane errands and things like “eating lunch”. I’ve seen guys do this to celebrities at places where the celebrity specifically goes for autograph signing/a scheduled appearance, but it’s really just women who follow people around, doe-eyed and supplicating, in some weird attempt at getting acknowledgement from their sex object *du jour*.

You take away his celebrity status, and Justin Bieber is a *shockingly* normal looking and behaving dude.  The only reason these people care is because they desperately want attention and social status and think that if they orbit hard enough, they can leech some of it from him.  I know there’s a direct male parallel to this, I just can’t bring it to mind right now.  Maybe supermodels? Idk though. Men who creep seem to be equal opportunity  creepists and will do this to the unknown attractive girl on the dance floor at a club, whereas women really just creep on the most famous and wealthy men.",Noreplytoidiots,30,2021-08-16 15:26:24

MildlyInfuriating,I finally caught the lying shit on camera.,1iauwjc,m9dbz01,"Fun fact as to why it does this:

Washing machine cycles generally finish with a “spin” phase where the faster it spins the more water is extracted from your clothes, leaving then less wet when you transfer to the dryer. This lets the dryer use less energy drying them. 

The cycles needs to hit a certain spin speed for a certain duration to meet the time estimate. When your clothes are off balance inside the drum, high spin speeds become dangerous because they will cause vibrations so the machine slows down, tries to mix up the clothes again to more evenly redistribute the weight, and then spin back up to high speeds. This adds extra minutes to the predicted time on the display.

A couple points to make you feel better. The chicken dumplings aren’t that bad flavor wise. And it’s damn near impossible to make anything in a styrofoam box look good. 
And a couple points to make you feel bad. They’re gonna essentially be serving making everything straight from a Sysco/us foods prepared menu because it’s cost/safety effective no matter the price point of their care facility. And secondly, if you think the foods bad, most places will pay minimum wage or barely above to all lower level employees( you know, the ones doing all the work) so disgruntled behavior and sketchy shit is sadly common. 
So what can you do about it?  Personally my best bet is to make an appearance, visit your loved one and other residents. Let their facility know who you are and absolutely make a fuss if shits not right. Administration is lazy and complacent in these facility but will absolutely fix things to get you to leave them alone.

Ive seen folks with a plate like this, for a couple reasons:

1. Theres always a boiled vegetable. Ive heard the chefs lament making them, but they will get complaints that the fresh steamed veggies were ""too tough to chew"" no matter how its done.

2. There is casserole days. Its a cuisine and food style that a lot of depression era residents are comforted by. What you don't see are Also Greek salads, reubens, bbq chicken wings, and the like (at least where I'm at). But theres always options provided. Which leads me to 3

3. A delivery order is made up of what they ask for. If they wanted ""casserole and veggies"" and not the other sides/soups/or salad, then this is what she got. Portions are small bc they don't eat too much (and with the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, this is a good health decision)


I have seen so many people be like ""why is grandma only eating a grilled cheese and applesauce for every dinner???""

Bc thats what she WANTS. We give the option, but we arent going to force your grandparents to eat something they dont want.

As for the staffing, yeah, its an industry issue. People dont want to be in the medical field during all this. Not for the pay rate most of these communities are offering.

These were the upscale private facilities, and the other nurses won't help a woman sliding out of her chair and peeing herself because""she's just doing it for attention"" when she'd been asking for assistance for 25+ minutes

If you have family in care facilities, keep an eye on them, check in with them, because these places are often nightmares",thatonequeerkidd,7,2021-09-26 20:35:59

MildlyInfuriating,No wonder the actual good movies don't win,1k54cu9,mofhbun,"While the fact that this wasn’t a requirement before is indeed infuriating, I have a question for the OP:

What do you mean by “the actual good movies don’t win?” Have you seen all of the BP winners and nominees the past decade? Because as someone who has seen every winner and nominee the past decade, I 100% disagree with the notion that “good movies don’t win.”

For reference, here’s the winners from the past 15 years that I thought were absolutely well-deserved, at least out of the nominees:

- Oppenheimer (2023)
- Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)
- Parasite (2019)
- Moonlight (2016)
- 12 Years a Slave (2013)
- The Artist (2011) (albeit only due to a lack of competition)

All of these are (in my opinion) unquestionably deserved wins, and all of them (except The Artist) are still talked about to this day. 

There were a handful of others that I thought were still great movies, even if at least one of the nominees would have been a much better choice; Anora, Nomadland, Birdman, and maybe The King’s Speech.  

The rest of the wins were completely undeserved though.",aheaney15,30,2025-04-22 13:44:28

We believe that it would not be in our best interest to purchase the remainder of OUR ITEMS, as that would lend credence that the ownership of [item] was ever yours to begin with.

Please be advised that total cost of [item] including shipping was [x$]. We will expect full payment by [date].

Failure to pay by [date] WILL result in a police filing and may (will) incur further legal penalties as suggested by our legal counsel.

Get it back, have a B overall, tell him I'm not coming back.

Grades are posted at the end of the semester, I'm marked as a D. I go to him and ask what's up with that. He says ""Well, you didn't attend the last 3 weeks and that caused you to dip below my attendance policy, so you lost points per the syllabus.""

I said ""What was the point of telling you I wasn't returning after the final if you were still counting it against the attendance policy? I could have just told you nothing and missed as many of the last 3 weeks of classes as I had left to miss and it wouldn't have changed anything in that case.

Both answers are  saying literally the same thing, but the TA would give you the same number of points (0) as someone else if they answered with “to be a potato”. It was beyond ridiculous. 

Lots of students complained (that’s just one random example, there were tons), but the prof decided that they’d rather blindly have their TA’s back than to intervene in any way.

What’s extra annoying is that a buddy of mine took the class the semester before with a different TA who was actually reasonable, and enjoyed the class and got a good but well earned grade.

So I get to the student clinic, and the doctor sits me down and has me do a bunch of things - blink, scrunch my forehead, wiggle my jaw, etc, basically have me move all my facial muscles.  


He goes off to grab a few other doctors.  They do the same rigmarole - asking me to make different faces, and mumbling amongst themselves ""yes, yes, typical case, uh huh, definitely good for everyone to see this, yadda yadda"".  


After about five minute of me being their trained monkey I finally stop and ask, pointedly ""WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. WRONG. WITH. ME?""  


They snap back to reality, realizing there's a terrified human being in front of them.  ""Oh, it's called Bell's Palsey.  You'll be fine in 4 to 6 weeks."" and give me the general run down on it.  


And they were right.  30 years later the only symptom I have is an extremely minor tightening in the jaw muscle on one side of my face that isn't even visible, just something I can feel when I go hunting for it (like right now as I type this).",MikeBegley,111,2022-07-19 22:18:04

MildlyInfuriating,Multi billion dollar businesses asking for donations....,uiba3f,i7bh3pa,"Donating to charity through a business campaign is a perfectly fine way to donate to charity. There is no nefarious tax evading benefit to the business, that is a myth perpetuated by people who don't understand how taxes work. 

The benefit to the business is the PR that they get from advertising their charity campaigns. 

If you don't want to contribute to such a PR campaign, then that's understandable for sure. But at the very least, the charity campaign itself promotes awareness of the charity and its cause, and might contribute to increased donations from people who otherwise wouldn't have thought to give. 

So in short this is misplaced indignation. You can be upset about corporations not giving back to the community as much as they should, but don't express it in a way that demonizes the small ways they DO give back.",TooSoonTurtle,697,2022-05-04 17:42:25

MildlyInfuriating,Geek squad mounted my TV to the sewage pipe,12bxywy,jezc6u8,"Pro tips.  Just because the stud sensor says there is something solid there, keep measuring.  Wood studs are usually pretty consistent, while other things (like sewer pipes) are not. 

One thing so do is use little magnets that stick to the drywall nails.  Once so have three or more lined up, it helps me figure out where the studs actually are.

Edit: as others have mention, standard for regular walls are 16” on center.  Ie you should be able to find. 1.5” wide wood stud every 16 inches, with a line of sheet rock nails going down it somewhat in the center.",tiggers97,162,2023-04-04 23:02:37

No insulation in the wall or any fire separation, PVC pipe, the pencil marking is outlining the large cutout, and from what it seems is dead center of the pipe (like they knew it was there prior to cutting), then you have excessively large cutout of the sheet rock. This doesn't look right at all.

However, the way ours is set up, they give us 5 chances to pass the quiz. Theres about 6-7 quizzes per unit (10-25 questions) and usually 10 or 11 units per class. You need 80% to pass. This is very time consuming, and frankly, doing them drives me fucking nuts. Most of the time, theres 4 multiple choice answers per question. Usually the questions remain the same through every attempt.

So, go through it once and write down each question. Pick an answer, any answer. Write down whether its correct or not. By the 4th or 5th attempt, you'll have every correct answer or enough correct to pass the quiz.

Teaching now is not like it was when we were kids. Grades aren’t allowed to be a surprise on report card day— if a kid was struggling I had to reach out and make a plan with the adult as soon as that kid got a C— and the cut off at my school for a C was an 84. 

But we also weren’t allowed to communicate only for bad things, so if I had to reach out because Jimmy was acting a fool 8 times this month, I also had to reach out to make sure grandma knew he helped another kid find his homework which was a great demonstration of our School Character Trait of Teamwork, and that he stayed late to help me sharpen pencils.

I met my girlfriend one night at one of our favorite bar/restaurants and she beat me there by about 15 minutes. Bartender was all over her and super friendly before I got there and gave her a free drink when alone but when he asked what she’s doing there alone she said waiting for my boyfriend his whole demeanor changed instantly and was no longer interested in her tattoos or giving her free drinks lol. So embarrassing to be a dude like that. when I got there it was like she was invincible and got no service while he served other guests 2 times before even thinking about acknowledging me to take my drink order. Had to go to a different bar. 

Left a review and haven’t gone back since. 

One of the few reasons I want kids is to raise better men than what is currently out there and set better examples that a woman’s value as a human has nothing to do with your chances of having sex with them.

Had a guy no show to an event and ask for a refund 10 months afterward. 10 months after the event. The order was more than a year old. We said no of course, and he left us a one star review on Yelp claiming all kinds of crap.

MildlyInfuriating,Avoiding feeding hungry kids,lk4jlv,gnij6y1,"I remember back in the 1st grade we had pizza day, my mom had paid for me to get pizza but the school made a mistake and thought she didn't. I didn't bring a lunch, because I was suppose to have pizza. The staff refused to give me any pizza (even though there was TONS of extra slices left over) they just made me sit at the cafeteria table while everyone else ate pizza, and I had nothing. One of my friends was nice and gave me a slice of her pizza, and my mom raised hell at the school for it. It just shocks me when I think back about it because any of the staff could have given me a slice or two and still had plenty left over, but chose to let a 6 year old sulk in the cafeteria and go hungry over a few bucks (and to be clear I know that the staff were obviously instructed to only give pizza to those who paid, but it wouldn't have actually made a difference if they gave me a slice)  


Same thing happens in middle/high school cafeterias, you get your food and when you go to pay for it, if you  realize you forgot your money at home or something, the staff take the food from you and throw it in the garbage can right in front of you (they had a big garbage can right beside the cashier and would regularly toss food if people couldn't pay or didn't have enough change).

They would rather let a child have to starve for the rest of the school day instead of letting them have lunch.

Food they had *spent their own money on.* We ended up having protests outside of the school and parents got involved.

I love the whole ""let us know if you need further clarification"" part. 

Um yeah, I have a question, wtf were they smoking when they were learning to do percentages? Their math ain't mathin'.

Reply with this:

Dear [Name],

Thank you for your message. However, I noticed a discrepancy in the calculation of my new hourly rate. The email states that a 10% raise was applied, but the new rate provided—$26.38—reflects only a 0.1% increase.

To clarify:

- My previous hourly rate was $26.35.
- A 10% increase would bring the new hourly rate to $28.99 (calculated as $26.35 × 1.10) rather than the claimed $26.38 (calculated as $26.35 × (1 + 0.10/100).

It seems there may have been an error in the calculation. 

To reiterate and highlight how this would be considered as a miscalculation, let us presume this formula applied as a 10% gratuity on a $100 restaurant bill (we shall use $100 for simplicity's sake). $100 × (1 + 0.10/100) would equal to a total of $100.10, rather than $110 if considering a 10% gratuity.

If 10 cents is an incorrect amount for a 10% gratuity on a $100 restaurant bill, then I would inquire as to how it would be logical to presume that an increase of 3 cents would be correct for a 10% raise on an hourly wage of $26.35.

I am sure you see now why it would therefore be understandable for me to ask you to please review the formula and confirm the correct adjusted rate. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

I had to spend 2 hours on the phone with them to correct their math. They couldn’t figure out how to calculate positive and negative numbers. This is what, 4th grade or 5th grade math? And they just couldn’t figure it out.

There was no way I was conceding. It eventually had to go all the way up to a Director in HR to verify the math. And then they finally got it right.

As I'm sure that u understand they mass produce the air pods

This means that with less money than it costs to repair an entire unit or replace all parts... they can manufacture multiple brand new units

Parts are made and sent to be assembled. Parts are assembled and the product is shipped. They don't want to have parts on hand just waiting for shit to break because that's money just sitting there and the second the product is replaced by a new version you take all that money and throw it in the literal garbage. You also have to employ people who just repair shit all day, rather than assemble. Which takes a higher level of expertise believe it or not. 

Now because it's apple it's pretty easy to assume this is on purpose and it probably is. But tons of products are this way simply because the cost to stand all that up is higher than the customers you'd lose to poor experiences with this type of process.

MildlyInfuriating,My Airbnb estimate - no wonder bookings are down,y7q44i,iswozbx,"Story time!!! 

Used Airbnb religiously in early days, was fairly priced and competitive. Over the years as they got more expensive found myself using hotels more. The last Airbnb I used (5 months ago) was for 6 nights. There was a $200 cleaning fee.

When we arrived, there was used condoms, sex toys, etc in the cushions (couch) and the bed sheets had stains (wasn’t about to find out what kind). There was no washer or dryer either as advertised along with a slew of issues.

I tried to work it out with the host, told him it was unacceptable and would like him to cancel the trip and refund me so I can just book another place, he agreed and I booked another place. I was too busy enjoying my vacation that I didn’t notice he didn’t cancel. 

I not only got charged + cleaning fee, the host submitted a claim for an additional $2500 in cleaning fees and damages.  His proof were pictures of a house that weren’t his, and receipts for “repairs” that are just regular shopping receipts dated a year ago.

Even after pointing all this out airbnb sided with the host, even with proof of our messages in app regarding the sex toys/contraceptives/ and agreement to cancel + refund, and the second booking for a nearby place also through Airbnb. 

Mind boggling right? Well it gets better, he then accused me of doing drugs in the house, claimed he had cameras inside (which is against Airbnb tos btw), Airbnb calls me and tells me my accounts disabled due to host uploading proof of drug use in house, even when I tried to challenge it (i was being petty at this point), pointing out the fact that cameras aren’t supposed to be inside house, it wasn’t until I threatened to sue for defamation since my account was disabled not banned, which was under my real name, which was publicly accessible, and had a very defamatory review by the host on my profile, that they “investigated” and then came back to “apologize” since they never actually seen proof from the host and it was just a verbal claim.

I then asked for my account to be disabled which they said they couldn’t do, and couldn’t remove the blatantly false review, mind you my review of the place was removed from his profile even tho it was pinpoint accurate.

It was only when I went through lawyer that they deleted my account so that bs review doesn’t show up (privacy laws in my state came in clutch). Never using Airbnb again. Legitimately over 50 stays/200 nights over the course of years. Must’ve paid them thousands in fees. 

Their support is shit, their fees are horrible, the scams are rampant, and they let it run. Honestly love hearing shit like this, can’t wait to hear how they went bankrupt.

Also me being petty I called the housing complex management office of the Airbnb and reported it for short term rentals which wasn’t allowed and the listing was removed a few days later :D",Formal_Performer_479,33,2022-10-19 06:47:41

Damn, that took a while. Used the two started decipherings with red text as a starting point. I directly deciphered the text - there are some spelling errors or times where I feel like OP forgot their own letters (fx. M) and using another (O) instead. Not the best script for quick reading as OP differentiated between the incline of lines and length, which was very hard to distinguish sometimes (I also now noticed I wrote ""croves"" instead of ""cloves""). Thanks for the fun challenge :)

Full transcript of my translation:

sweat about one third cup diced onion

or shallot or about four cloves of

garlic diced or crushed in three or

four tablespoons of butter when the

onions are trasnlucent or the garlic

is sticky add one cup of arborio or

even sushi rice and cook until mostly

translucent and evenly oily then add

a quarter t a half cup white wine or

skip to first addition of chicken

broth when wine is aloost fally

absorbed add a cup of chicken

broth and boil stirring constantly

until aloost fully absorbed and

repeat until rice is nearly fully

cooked then turn off the heat and

add half a cup paroisan and one or

two tablespoons of butter or olive

oil and stir until evenly mixed and

a good texture adding chicken broth

or heat as necessary cou can also

add a dash of olive oil or lemon juice

in the serving bowl

MildlyInfuriating,I have entire journals written in code I no longer remember how to translate.,1jpjv7t,ml1o1g2,"My friend sent me a link to this, and it took me an hour to fully decipher. Looks like other people deciphered it already, but I didn't see people talk about how it was clearly made: it's Morse Code!! A straight line (horizontal) is long (Dah), and a diagonal line is short (dih). A vertical line is multiple short (dih dih, or dih dih dih). So, D and B look similar, but the line on the bottom is a bit longer because D is -.. and B is -...

This is actually a pretty cool way of writing morse code, and I might use a similar version of it for myself. :)  
Edit: I actually saw deeper in one of the convo's someone talking about the morse code and how it's structured, which gives a visual description of it as well.",Leading-Programmer-6,6,2025-04-02 16:23:30

MildlyInfuriating,I have entire journals written in code I no longer remember how to translate.,1jpjv7t,ml5m1cv,"I used ChatGPT to attempt to read this off of the theory that you’re using an English Replacement Cypher. Following some of the basic rules: E is one of the most common used letters, A and I are their own letters and words, and a few other basic rules, we were able to do some deciphering by using placeholders and context clues. At the end of the process, I used the fragmented sentences and bits to join them into a restructured narrative, and here are the results:

Reinterpreted Story:

“That the train never stopped was the first thing you missed.
The way you stared—it wasn’t just movement, it was memory.
After it passed, it took more than time with it.
He took the light. And before you could move—don’t.

They have not survived. Not really.
And then, the story became yours. A thread passed down, a whisper.
Don’t you see the signs? Don’t you hear what they left for you?

He then lost something he never named.
The reason for that… no one knew. Not even him.
The body was not inside. Just emptiness. A shell. A space.

The basin leads to the trail. Downward, always downward.
I will tell you the story there, if you follow.

Return. To where it began.
Under that place—it ended. It always ends.

And then… it turned cold.
Rib by rib, it broke apart.
Not with a scream, but with silence.”",Corporate_Chinchilla,6,2025-04-03 05:39:14

All flat surfaces, parks, grass, sidewalks, benches, parking garages, everything is covered with homeless people, and garbage. Feces, needles, urine, rotting food, clothes, blankets. You name it. So much trash. Portland built a large homeless village with small homes. Including bathrooms, laundry, showers and electricity. It was completely destroyed and un-inhabitable within a few months. Homeless people destroy everything around them. The issue with homeless people is that most are addicts or mentally unhealthy. They don't want help. The help they need is rehab or therapy. But thats expensive, and it's hard to convince an addict to quit, or a mentally sick person that they need help.

1) How close they've been to being homeless.

2) How many homeless people are in their area.


Generally, I try to have empathy.  I've been close to homelessness (unemployed, no family to rely on, and unable to make rent for a month), so I get how this shit can happen, and how hard it this to recover from.

On the flip side, I'm not in that situation anymore.  Now, I have a home and a job.  My car has been vandalized by homeless people, and I had to put a buzzer on the door to my office to keep homeless people from wandering in and assaulting the people that work with me.  I can't even go to the store without stepping over some junkie on the sidewalk (beautiful Austin scenery).

If someone is strungout on drugs and suffering from severe mental disease, I have no empathy.

MildlyInfuriating,Welcome to America,uzn0h9,iabx5v4,I don't condone it but I definitely understand it. Take Austin for instance. 6th street was party street and people cane from all over Texas to hang out and have fun there. Then they built a homeless shelter one street up and now 6th is just nothing but homeless people fighting and drinking. Literally turned 6th street from an amazing place to a shithole.,TeemoMainBTW,5,2022-05-28 16:57:24

MildlyInfuriating,Welcome to America,uzn0h9,iabl01f,"Nearby where I live they tore down a homeless shelter that was very out of the way. Barely anyone even knew it was there but now there's just homeless everywhere on the streets, abandoned shopping carts all over the side walk, homeless skulking about at very late hours. I can't blame them either because the city made them more homeless than they already were. At least with the makeshift homeless shelter they stayed to themselves and mostly stayed hidden. Now that they're spread out people can see how bad the homeless problem in my area actually is. The reason the city tore it down is because it's hidden but still easily accessible from the road so the cops like to sit there and do speed traps. I guess what I'm trying to say is that cities need to stop actively making homeless peoples lives worse.",andhowsherbush,5,2022-05-28 15:22:41

MildlyInfuriating,Welcome to America,uzn0h9,iabr3jh,Unfortunately where homeless people come a lot of drugs and crime end up there as well. It's a sad and inevitable outcome when these places aren't regulated properly. There's homeless who just want to get well and get on their feet and then there's the homeless who are so broken they just want the next high or drunk. It creates a stereotype and then they all pay for it. Heavily regulated shelters with organizations that genuinely care would combat this. I always wanted to do something in that field because I know what it's like to be in that position.,Murkybogsman,4,2022-05-28 16:10:09

MildlyInfuriating,Welcome to America,uzn0h9,iac3as1,"It looks like they're fighting against it because they're planning on building a shelter in a wealthy neighborhood.

Homeless people are generally suffering from mental illness and addiction, moreso than sudden poverty, so having a shelter up and several of these people around your neighborhood will likely affect property value.

Although some are making the claim, I can't say for sure whether or not this will have a significant effect on crime levels in said neighborhood, but image is everything for property value, and having a homeless shelter in your neighborhood definitely can tank the value of your house, and with homes being an investment, they're basically saying ""if you're not willing to lose thousands (tens, maybe even hundreds) of dollars to help the homeless, (because whose to say this shelter has to be built in a residential neighborhood) then you're a sociopathic monster.""

Homeless shelters are good, but it sounds like some of these people have a right to be concerned about this beyond ""hating the homeless.""",Aluminum_Tarkus,5,2022-05-28 17:45:33

There was a small, annexed area in this facility where maybe.. a dozen people worked during the day, but they were gone by the time my shift started, and I was gone by the time theirs started. 

Anyways. At the very back wall was an unused dry erase board. Every night, I’d walk by it, and there was never a thing on it. So I decided to start doodling a very tiny picture each night. 

I showed up one night and there was a pack of fresh, assorted colored markers! So I continued to doodle. Then one day, I showed up to my shift and our captain was there. He explains to me that there were complaints about a board being “vandalized” in the annexed area. He new I was always drawing and what have you, but as I worked in a Top Secret facility, there were no actual cameras on the interior. So of course, I shrugged and told him I hope we can bring the fugitive to justice. This little dance went on for like 2 weeks. I decided to work over one shift and walked back there to actually fess up to the ladies in the annex. I explained everything I just typed out and the team lead back there said, and I quote, “to hell with all of them, we absolutely love it asking in to a new doodle.”

If I were the police, I’d look at driveways visible from the park, with a small sedan and big truck in the driveway. Possible oil spots on the ground if they change their oil outside, or in the garage if they change it there. Possible zoning dispute? Parking, traffic, and noise level of the park would be my guess. 

That, or possibly just some angsty teens. Even then, I feel like this seems kind of calculated for some dumbass kids. Oil on the surfaces of playground equipment? If a toddler fell and died, this would be a murder scene. Teenagers like TP’ing houses, skateboarding in parking lots, and being obnoxious at Walmart. This seems targeted and malicious",foodfarmforage,244,2025-02-25 16:23:25

That 15W-40 is typically used in a big diesel truck, while the 0W-20 is for a high-mileage SUV or sedan—meaning the suspect likely owns both.

First step: Check the homes around the park. Look for a garage big enough for diesel oil changes—someone who works on their own vehicles.

You don’t target children’s playgrounds unless the kids are pissing you off, which points to a neighbor with a grievance.

Transporting that much oil isn’t easy on foot. More likely, they loaded it in their truck bed, leaving residual oil there—plus footprints, door handle smudges, or spills.",Brock_,44,2025-02-25 16:07:33

MildlyInfuriating,I'm crying,1i8buez,m8xyyw5,"Haha you can tell the cat lovers/owners vs the cat haters/non owners... 

Can't imagine stepping on poop litter after a shower: we clean after our pets, sweep, etc. like YOU clean after your snot nosed kids, who I guarantee are worse walking germ factories. 

Who puts a litterbox in the bathroom? The bathroom is where poops all around happen... Duh. Should they put it in the bedroom(oh no how could you sleep with poop nearby your head is the next complaint) Should they put it in the kitchen(oh no that's where you prepare food is the next complaint) Make the cat go outside (not all cats are outdoor cats. There are dangers in some places like coyotes and wild animals. Some people live in apartments, etc.) Not everybody has a 2 story house. With limited rooms, bathroom is the best place. Use common sense.

Why would you have a litterbox with no lid? Because cat owners who actually give a heck about their cat's comfort have cats that don't prefer lids. Or they are elderly cats and need easy in and out to do their business. 

With all that being said, just breathe.... Take yourself a chill pill. True cat owners find this inconveniencing, yet funny.

Relax, I wasn't rude. Just like you, I voiced my opinion. Don't get your tighty whities in a bunch. Enjoy the weekend y'all!

MildlyInfuriating,Gf found the engagement ring a week before I was going to propose...,1eqs64c,lhvzbks,"My fiance was so excited to propose, he even showed me the ring before he bought it. Made me try it in the store because he was so afraid I would not like it. Then, after he had saved up the money and finally ordered it online, he kept updating me on the delivery status. ""Now it's in x town"". ""Now its in z town"". ""Just 2 days left"". ""I think it'll be here tomorrow"".  When it arrived we both drove down to the post office to pick it up. He could not wait.

Later that day he wanted to make a romantic dinner. But because he was so eager, there was no time to cook anything nice. So we just ate pasta leftovers. Then he proposed. Even though I had seen the ring, and knew exactly when I was gonna be proposed to, I still cried of joy. It was still the happiest day of my life.

That evening, we inscribed our initials and the date into a tree just outside our house. He spent so many evenings near that tree, trying to make the inscription look good. To be honest, it looks kinda odd - but I would never change anything about it. 

When I sit in the livingroom and look outside our window, I can see his quirky looking inscription on the tree. It takes me back to the day he proposed. How he loved me so much that he could not wait for the ring to arrive. How I love him so much and would never, ever change a thing about that day. It's our precious story.

My mom was kinda crushed at first because she really wanted to give it to me for my birthday, but I didn't give I shit I was so fuckin happy. So then she was happy too. We still joke about it, like 25 years later. It was my favorite birthday present ever.

He wasn't talking about our future anymore because he didn't want to spill the beans! My friend in the dorm next door heard him and comes running in and says, ""you told her didn't you!"" 

We picked up my ring in a snow storm. It was at the mall. We had dinner and he clicked the box under the table several times to tease me. We got back to my dorm and he proposed in the parking lot (the good one by the dorm, lol) in a snow storm, under the street lights. It wasn't what he planned, but it was perfect for us. We have never been able to keep secrets from each other, and are the kind of people to exchange gifts early. He is genuinely my best friend. We have been together 22 years, married for 16 years.

Their decision was allegedly partially based on people upgrading from previous Iphone models throwing away the charger and or headphones that came with the new model because they already had an existing one. By no means am I saying this wasn't a profit-based decision, it's just not a complete disaster.

Edit:  Reading the responses i want to add a comment.

Even though not everyone would throw away a charger or a pair of headphones immideately, they're still produced as if everyone is in need of one. The problem isn't exclusively about the waste created when thrown away, it is also about the cost and ""waste"" of manufacturing when there isn't the need.

You simply don't put up rules that affects everyone in the company/department without your boss knowing, that would create chaos.",frisch85,95,2022-08-10 12:22:41

My mom had a similar situation happen. She was cleaning and was about to head home for the day, when the clients daughter starts screaming at her, accusing her of stealing her ring. If I recall correctly, the ring was valued at +20k. Mind you, my mom has worked with her for years! My mom packed her bags, and called the cops from her car. Long story short, daughter pissed her pants and admitted she planted it somewhere where my mom was not going to clean that day (as the client told her it was being occupied at the moment and she could do the room next visit). My mom promptly yelled at her now former client about having people accuse her of something so awful. She depends on her reputation to receive clients. Oh she gave her the yelling of a lifetime, and the cops just looked at the client / daughter with disgust. She left and never looked back. Thanked the cops for coming. Cops told her best to not come back. 

So long story short. Good for you for taking a picture. Write a note telling them found the money, and drop them. It’s not worth risking yr reputation, especially if you work under the table like my mom has.
