They treated the place as party central and that was usually ok it was interactions with neighbours. 

Be sure who you invite round, set a rule, see if they agree.If they laugh or won't agree please don't let them come round.

I hope everything is great and enjoy that safe feeling when you lock the door and sleep. Take care and stay safe.",None,389,2022-01-01 00:18:28

Nobody else gave these kids a shot but they are so talented and so dedicated. I’m so proud of them every week!

MadeMeSmile,Guy gets to feel like a kid again instead of being seen as creepy,oy86j3,h7ug4wa,"I wanna share one! 

Lockdown, live in a small apartment complex, have a 3 y/o daughter. Two little boys around 8 and 6 come stay with their grandma several days out of the week since school ended. My daughter was always watching them through the window, and began asking if she could go play with them. I was hesitant for a while as they’re older, I don’t know these boys, what if they don’t understand they’d need to be less rough around her as she’s very little? Finally it was making me too sad seeing her cooked up inside with no kids to play with, I opened the door and asked if she could play with them. THEY WERE SO SWEET, they welcomed her, shared their toys, they would help her if she fell down, or needed help figuring out the scooter. Their grandma would send snacks out and give an extra for my kiddo. I was just so delightfully surprised two older kids, boys especially, would be so welcoming and kind to a 3 y/o girl. It brought joy to those previously dull afternoon lockdowns. Someone raised these boys right, and I’m so appreciative of their kindness.",mama_emily,6,2021-08-05 19:29:10

You see a point in his career where something traumatic and fucked up happens and takes him out of the game.

But what if that hadn't happened? Who knows ultimately, but I think it's likely that he would have been a mainstay mainstream top of the line action star actor for many years to come.

Cut to the end of the game, Ireland wins, the place goes nuts. Once it all starts to calm down and people start leaving, curiosity gets the better of him and he taps the old man on the shoulder. 

“Excuse me sir, couldn’t help but notice ya got an empty seat next to ya. How is that possible? This is the biggest game in Ireland for decades. Maybe ever!”

“Oh, that’s me wife’s seat. She passed away recently. We’ve gone to every home game together the last forty years, never missed a single match together, and that’s just her seat.”

I can def recommend them.

MadeMeSmile,"After this man's wife passed away, his children adopted a shelter dog for him to keep him company. Best decision in the world",syy2rg,hy0smd5,"My father lived alone after my mother died, So for one Christmas I decided to buy him a little dog, something to look after and to love, take for walks and get a bit of exercise.

I got a shih tzu, they are good companion dogs and it was the only suitable breed the pet shop had. Before Christmas I toilet trained the little thing, first getting him to do his biz on newspapers then moving the papers to the door then outside. He got the message eventually. When he had an accident he'd hide under the bed in shame and have to be coaxed out.

He was the perfect gift, my dad wasn't parted from the dog till his death, 14 years later.   
I inherited the now elderly dog.   
I was a bit resentful, I had a young family and enough problems, but the little dog got under my skin and became my favourite member of the house. Always pleased to see me, jumping up and running in circles when I walked in the door from work, always happy.

As he aged he wouldn't be able to rush up to greet me, and had to be carried up and down the stairs, all he could do is push his head into me.
the last night he lost the use of his back legs. It was time to let him go. I let him sleep on the bed with me that night.

next morning I couldnt find him.
What broke my heart is he'd dragged himself off the bed in the night to do his biz on a old newspaper I'd casually discarded on the floor, but didnt quite make it and left a puddle... then just like all those years ago, he crawled under the bed in shame and there he died.

If only I'd woken up and told him not to worry.

The animals available for fostering are generally either awaiting a medical procedure, or recovering from one. It's an easy and cost-free process that can provide a home and time out of shelter until the animal is medically cleared to be up for adoption. From my experience the foster time frames are for as little as a few days to a couple weeks, quite approachable for people that love animals but can't commit to owning one.

At older ages, you are more prone to health complications and physical disabilities. Having their lifelines is one thing, but if they put them down for whatever reason and end up falling or they fall unconscious before getting the chance to use the lifeline, it renders it completely useless. 

Having cameras set up in rooms is acceptable purely because it’s for their safety. Not just ‘might hurt theirself’, but ‘might die’ levels of safety.",Heathen_Inferos,21,2022-02-22 23:00:52

MadeMeSmile,This is what the hobby is all about,1imdroz,mc2pa5n,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this is called clip farming. The cost of the cards he gives away is much less than the revenue he gains from having them go viral and get many views. He only does this on camera for content, it’s like youtubers giving strangers money or gifts, yes out of context it seems like a good deed, they’re making greater revenue from the content than what they’re giving away, so it’s not altruistic or selfless. 

It’s one step away from the people who stage animal rescue clips when they’re the one who put the animal in peril. These people will do whatever it takes for views, it so happens that it sometimes materializes as a good deed, many times it does not and that’s the problem, views are the goal, not kindness, for every guy doing this there’s 10 people scamming for the same reason. This is a symptom of a sick society. 

Like it or not, that’s the truth. You’re so brainwashed by social media that you probsbly thought this was an organic encounter, when in fact it’s a guy setting up a camera then telling parents to bring their kid to the counter so he can make his content for views/adrev/redirects.",Ruiner357,14,2025-02-10 20:41:00

MadeMeSmile,This is awesome,1iedpv9,ma6vi0z,"I used to ride my bicycle to the bus stop to get to work.  One time I got a stopped by a state trooper for riding my bike through the bollards when they were up (state capitol) to catch the bus and I saw my bus pass I knew I was going to be late.  

Said f it I’m riding the 12 miles down the highway to get to work now so I’m not too late for my fast food job (I was working myself out of homeless at the time).  Turned the corner and the bus driver had waited for me (not even at a stop!) he said he saw me getting stopped by the cop! 

It was such an unbelievably nice gesture of people looking out for each other. It was downtown in a busy area so I was flabbergasted that the city bus would do something for someone like me.   I never forget that.

Edit- thanks for all the kind words and awards.  Never told anyone this story and didn’t think it would strike a chord with so many ppl.  I wish you all the best and have a great weekend ;)",organisms,24987,2025-01-31 13:23:23

MadeMeSmile,This is awesome,1iedpv9,ma7i6up,"Reminds me of when I was back in high school, taking 3 city buses to get to school. The 2nd bus ride was about an hour. Me and the kind, elderly bus driver I saw every morning became quite friendly over the next few years. 

His last day before retiring, we arrived at the bus station, (where I'd typically depart, and wait for my last bus). I got off last, just to have time to wish him happy retirement, (and gave him a little card I got him). I'll never forget his smile as I handed him the card.

He then told me to sit back down, as he's got one more stop to make. I was confused for a second, (as the route was done), but he told me that for his final stop ever, he asked if I'd like a lift to school. I said I didn't want him to get in trouble, but he said it's his last day, and that was his wish. He called dispatch, and proceeded to drive me, in a city bus, ALL the way across town to the school's front door.

Still makes me teary thinking about it...
Thanks, Mike! 🙏🎉🫶",ZeeeMonster,3621,2025-01-31 15:28:18

1. This wasn't some kind of sole train for her, it was a stop for a remote area (like 10 or 20 homes were in the area) in between two smaller towns. She lived in the outskirts of the tiny towns. So, this was a minor stop for the train.

2. The station was makeshift and had no power or serious infrastructure. It was basically a platform with a roof for weather for the locals to get on. Again, not an inconvenience.

3. The station was in the middle of two more popular stations and was like a 15min bike/5min car ride to those stations. The locals did not need this station as they could drive/bike to the nearest one. Aside from the winter, she probably didn't need this station. 

Now, I'm not stating that this was a bad thing to keep open. Just that it wasn't a major thing for the station to help out this person as it was like a less than 10min ride in between the two other stations and she could have easily gone to the other ones. This was simply a nice thing for the train line to do as it really didn't cost them anything.",Gigantkranion,90,2025-01-31 15:00:11

There are recorded calls to the emergency number where you can hear people scream and cry and call for help. Most of them were young university students.

The collision would have been avoided had they installed all the safety systems that would warn the conductors/drivers/anyone of two trains on the same tracks heading toward each other. But no such systems were in place and the government blames the collision on human error.

Concrete was poured almost immediately on the site of the explosion, the son of one of the prosecutors on the case has disappeared.

Two years later there are still no answers and still no justice. Certain government officials openly say that the families of the dead, who seek justice, are doing it for money. Last Sunday, the Greeks protested in over 100 towns both in Greece as well as abroad demanding justice. The state channel ""ERT"" barely covered the topic.

MadeMeSmile,I can relate as a Big Brother,wi02ah,ij91t7z,"This reminds me of when I was in kindergarten and going to the same school as my brother, who was in 8th grade. We would get dropped off about a mile from our house and had to walk home if our neighbors weren’t there to pick us up. Along the way, there’s some train tracks that we had to cross. Idk why, but I was terrified of crossing the tracks. My brother, every single time, grabbed my backpack and lunch box, walked across the train tracks, dropped all of our stuff on the sidewalk, then came back, picked me up, and carried me across so I didn’t have to.

MadeMeSmile,I can relate as a Big Brother,wi02ah,ij8srnw,"Short Story time: me and my little brother when he was around 5 where playing in a jungle gym in the lobby of a nice hotel we were staying at. My little brother was sick at the time (diarrhoea etc.) but was almost fully recovered so we thought we were okay to leave the hotel room and have some fun for a while. Can’t remember where our parents where as I was probably only 12 or 13 (19 now). Anyway my little bro while climbing through a tunnel naturally lets one rip without thinking, as 5 year olds do. Unfortunately the poor kid followed through, in the lobby of a nice ass hotel. Not knowing where our parents were at the time I took him to the toilets in the lobby and cleaned him up but his pants were ruined. So I took my shirt off wrapped it around him and walked him back to the room. We already looked like bums in that hotel as we have money but don’t really care to dress the way the rest of the world with money dress, we don’t really care. But as a 13 year old I was scared of what everyone thought, yet did it anyway. Looking back I was very proud of how I took care of him like that and so we’re our parents. Now I’ve realised it’s just my brotherly duty.",FaithlessnessTop9938,19,2022-08-06 23:07:51

I mention this because Tony Hawk probably worked a lot when he was younger. He probably missed sports games and other events while he worked. Now that he's retired, he can focus on the new babies.",c_c_c__combobreaker,188,2024-09-30 22:38:50

Every day I would pick up a handful of litter and drop it in the bin. It was just a small thing every day, no real effort, I just made it my mission every walk to pick up some trash on my way, a little every day. 

After a few months it started to change noticeably, there was very little rubbish and most importantly I found that when an area is clean -people typically don’t tend to litter as much. It’s as if the existence of litter there already means that the litterer feels somehow permissioned to just add ‘one more’.

After a year or so I got more ambitious, I started climbing into bushes and up the less accessible slopes of the creek looking for rubbish, until all of it was pristine. A few years later, some time after I moved away from that house, when I returned I was so happy to see my little area I adopted was still clean. So proud of that.",None,4671,2022-05-15 14:14:58

I also am a beekeeper and I tell them to stay away from my bees and my foodplot I have alfalfa and clover planted for the bees and deer. They went abs did donuts on my foodplot tearing it up. So I started shutting & locking the gate. Then they busted the lock & snuck in so I got some 2x6 boards and out 4” screws in them and barrier them on the trails with just the screws sticking out. I flattened a lot of tires. I haven’t had anybody on me  in 3 weeks now. I live on the land to so if I’m outside I know they’re here. Disrespectful a-holes.,ruffneck110,552,2022-05-15 14:31:34

Take geographic context out and read the whole thing as if this man was from your country. It’s incredible. 

“My election [as president] only proves that the citizens are tired of the experienced politicians who over the past 28 years created a country of opportunities – opportunities to steal, bribe and loot. Let's build a country of other opportunities. Where everybody is equal before the law and where the rules of the game are honest and transparent, that are the same for everyone. And for this to happen, people who want to serve the nation, need to take office. And please, I really don't want you to hang my portraits on your office walls. Because a president is not an icon and not an idol. A president is not a portrait. Hang pictures of your children. And before you make any decision, look into their eyes.”

Also to notes he is advising his military to keep Africans in the country. Blocking them from leaving. This is coming from his command. He is not allowing black tourist to leave the country because they might organ harvesting or melanin harvest them because melanin is a time tired and the price of gold and it is used in a lot of electronics so I am really worried for the African population that is being held by the citizens and the military. Milliliter is videos of them being blocked from leaving we’re getting on the trains. But you are like a nice picture don’t you?

MadeMeSmile,That’s so cute,sabpaw,htt0dkx,"Reminds me of something I did in grad school. One of my close friends in my cohort was feeling super lonely with Valentine's day/Single's awareness day coming up, as she was originally from NC. She couldn't go home and see her friends/typical support system due to classes ongoing and it being an 8+ hour drive down.

I decided to do something sweet but was worried about the action being interpreted as romantic (me being male and single, her being female and also clearly single) so I contacted her BFF online to ask if my friend would appreciate some sort of gesture to show that people still cared about her. With her BFF's approval, I sent my friend a bouquet of flowers, chocolate covered strawberries (which I knew she loves) and an anonymous card that said ""You are still loved and appreciated"". 

As soon as she got it she sent me a text and said she ugly cried for an hour and that it made her weekend. I asked her if she knew who sent it and she assumed one of her friends at home but her other friends already denied it. Either way, it made me happy that I was able to pull her through that tough time, even anonymously.",sinofmercy,17,2022-01-22 23:12:30

My friends didn’t even skip a beat. At the convention I finally got to go to this past August, the hotel was not very disability friendly. I felt myself getting all guilty, all upset about being a burden, forcing them to go to and wait for the elevators every time just because I couldn’t hold my walker on the escalators. Well the three dudes all took turns holding my walker for me if we did go to the escalators (the elevators were jam packed). I would fuss and fumble and try to do it myself and one of them would grab my walker and just hold it up off the escalators so we could all go and then they’d roll it in front of me when we got off.

One good example happened to me a few weeks ago I was at breakfast at a local bakery with some friends and the owner stopped by to ask how are breakfast was and saw the shirt I was wearing and asked what it was for. I was wearing a band shirt that has blood and an old school razor on it. She took a look at it and said it was like something her niece would wear, I'm fully expecting snide comments when she surprised me. 

Next thing I know she whips out her phone and starts showing us all pictures of her niece's full on goth wedding and talking about how much fun she had and how she went all out getting to do spooky desserts for it including the wedding cake that had spiderwebs all over it. She went on about how while the bride's black wedding dress was unconventional it was absolutely beautiful and it perfectly matched her personality and complimented her tattoos. 

So even if you don't match the rest of the family it's good to know that some of them appreciate how you look and support it.

Closer to home, my grandma absolutely loved how my sister and I dressed over the years (both of us have gone through long term spooky phases and other forms of alternative fashion) and was always excited to see our new tattoos.",nerdgirl37,6,2024-09-13 02:04:28

On the one hand you have them play on the gender assigned at birth and they decide not to play, or they play on the gender they’ve transitioned to which may lead to major unfair advantages or disadvantages for them. 

It’s no big deal if it’s just in games and sports that are for fun, but i wonder if there is a solution for these issues if you want to maintain a competitive environment.",Titan7856,456,2022-07-25 12:06:54

MadeMeSmile,This is adorable,uhhevi,i775b2k,"My Mom passed away 15 years ago. She was a second level manager who worked her way up from a clerk. In the 60’s it was rare to see female management - especially a woman of color. My Mom was smart, fair, and kind. Those are the gifts she taught me. My Mom retired in her 40’s. It was abrupt and all of a sudden. Her company kept on asking her to extend way over the normal 6 months they usually allow. One of her employees asked me if I knew why my Mom retired so young and in such an abrupt manner. I really didn’t know - I thought maybe because she was financially ok and wanted to enjoy retirement. Her employee told me that there was a rumor going around that there were going to be layoffs on my Mom’s department and who was next on the chopping block was a single mother who already had a second job. My Mom retired so that lady’s job would be saved. I think I was 20 at the time. Obviously I loved my Mom my whole life but at that moment and for the rest of my life, I have never been prouder of her. Sorry if this was wrong of me to mention - I just miss my Mom everyday.",mrsgalvezghost,78,2022-05-03 19:28:04

After I studied and learned more about the man I realized he was one of the most respectable people of all time. His attempt at diffusing the war between Israel and Palestine is absolutely legendary. His good intentions from this one act will always paint him as a hero of humanity in my book. On top of that Reagan took credit for the prisoners he worked tirelessly to release. My parents and grandparents told me those prisoners were released because they were scared of Reagan. After learning about what actually happened it’s very clear they released those men because of the hard work Jimmy put into negotiations. It’s such bull shit that Reagan took credit for his hard work.

The United States chewed Jimmy up and spit him back out. Despite all of this the man continued to strive to do the right thing to this day.

I hover between 210 and 230 now, depending on my fluid intake (I have kidney disease and am a dialysis patient now). Hitting middle age makes the likelihood of losing weight even more difficult.

In case you missed it: some of the more famous tweets from Elon's pay for verification move were people hijacking brands, creating accounts that looked real and getting them certified 

One beautiful soul did this for US Pharma Giant ""Eli Lilly"" note Lilly on the package in OP's pic. They then tweeted

 ""Happy to announce insulin is now free"",

Then their stock PLUMMETED. With bad publicity from this and further pressure from government legislation/rising competition in the US preparing to offer affordable insulin, they announced last month they would sell insulin capped at $35 out of pocket max. Now I know it's not free and frankly dastardly overdue but this is literally lifesaving development for the Americans with diabetes - and helping it all was some smartass fucking with big pharma on Twitter.

Edit: Obviously there are other factors at play, I meant this as a romanticized view of what free speech can do. So to add the rest of the influences... The capping of insulin cost for seniors was legislated in the Inflation Reduction Act, But Eli Lilly has extended this to all not just those they are required to cap costs for under new legislation. They are also staring down rising competition to provide affordable insulin in the near future.  However, I'd like to think the massive scrutiny they have garned since the tweet had them playing PR damage control. Companies have long been under fire for expensive drugs, but that interest fades and any way to dial up the heat on them is welcome.",Ackaflocka,453,2023-03-09 20:54:01

Some more context (credit to u/AlaskanSuntan)

>This race was in 2016. A couple months earlier, she had recorded the second fastest time in history, and was the favorite going into the US Olympic Trials for the Rio Olympics. But she had a bad race and finished in eighth, missing out on the team.

>Without the Olympics to look forward to, two weeks later she ran this track meet in London and finally broke the world record. So it really was the ultimate consolation prize for not making the Olympic team.

>Here's the race, it's worth a watch! The clock error at the end just led to an even better moment when she did realize she broke the record. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQHBj4_sffw

MadeMeSmile,This is so pure,v623of,ibdktfl,"At my high school, people weren’t allowed to cheer for their kids, because it risked covering up the next name to be called. 
When I was getting ready to graduate, my eldest brother, who has essentially acted as my dad all this time, said that he would be willing to get kicked out just so he can cheer for me. The more and more I thought about it, the more that I just was excited for it. Out of all of the crippling anxiety that being on stage gave me, I knew I would of had him to at least cheer me on. High school was a struggle for me, just like it was for him, so it felt special to me. 

I can’t tell you how badly it broke my heart when I was called up, expecting to hear my brothers stupid ass call for me from the crowd and just, didn’t. It turns out that my mom and my sister convinced him not to do it.

Thank you for doing this right.  Either this or the pool are the correct way to lose weight BEFORE you start working out.  If you are obese, you can seriously hurt yourself trying to run or do calisthenics/lift weights until you have worked that excess weight off.

Great job, OP.  You look fantastic.

Also, of general note, nearly a pound a day is a pretty extreme rate of loss, but consider the caloric intake shift and the amount of water weight that was probably at play here.  You usually want to see a pound a week for sustainable weight loss for the average person.  I would discourage most people from trying to achieve a pound a day.",Send_Me_Broods,62,2021-05-19 14:40:14

MadeMeSmile,"Lost 200 pounds in a year through fasting and walking, then crushed my fear of working out around others at the gym!",ng50xt,gyp9mya,"For those looking to lose weight I just want to say temper your expectations and don't think this was an easy process. What this guy did is absolutely worth all the praise he is getting and if he is your inspiration to start your weight loss journey then good on you. 

But what he did is incredibly hard and if you decide to attempt something similar just be aware that there will be days where you fall back into old habits. But that is absolutely OK! Even if it takes you twice or three times as long as what it did him.

I also want to say be cautious when attempting what he did. The amount of weight he lost per week is boarding on unhealthy. From my limited knowledge it is typically recommended to aim for losing 1-2 pounds a week. What he did was roughly 3.8 pounds a week. I'd also like to suggest don't start everything right away, going into a calorie deficit or changing your diet significantly and starting to work out heavily all at once can wear at you and may cause some sustainibilty problems unless.

Focus on health like a health nut would for the first few years at least of recovery. Recovery from chemo is a long road. You're young. The next few-4 years sets the stage for how you will feel for the rest of your life, and you have a chance to make that feeling be great by pushing through some short term pain.
Dont compare your workouts to people whos body hasnt bee  poisoned excessively.  Just do you ,and know youll likely pass them in health in due time due to caring.
Also know that one day youll be sitting in your living room with your future family and it will hit you how important it was what you went through the last year. You will be so grateful you had the inner strength to perservere because life only gets better if you decide its going to.
Also lol im going to hell for telling a kid this but idgaf, if when your like 16-18 you find you have stomache nauseas and general ill feelings that remind you of and seem like remnants of chemo, try some weed its harmless and makes all chemo feels melt away. Doubt youll need it though homie youre young your body is gonna bounce back from this and itll be like it never happened in no time.

MadeMeSmile,School should be a place where kids want to be,1jrdi86,mldwtgm,"Gonna hijack this to share a warm anecdote. Former and current teacher here (just changed capacities recently). When I was teaching high school, I always stood outside my door to greet my students as they walked in. I’d say “hi” or “good morning” or whatever. Maybe even a “how are you?” Just normal salutations, right? Well, on the last day of school a few years ago, I had a student hand me a letter. In that letter, this student told me that one tragic day, a friend of theirs unexpectedly passed away. And I guess I noticed this student’s glumness no matter how hard they tried to hide it. In this letter, they told me I asked two or three times with a “you sure you’re okay?” kind of inquisitive attitude. I guess I noticed they weren’t well. They said that my worry and wonder about their disposition made their whole week better. Simply because I showed that I cared a bit. 

I’m sorry guys, I’m not trying to brag here. My point is that little things matter. People will forget what you say or did for the most part, but they’ll *never* forget how you made them feel. This is so critical for children. 

This teacher will be remembered forever by his students, because in each one of his interactions, his students are being *seen.* Go him, whatever his name is.",GeneralPhartCaulk,1175,2025-04-04 15:10:52

We are doing our best, folks. Doing our best. 

I saw the other day that some of my boys had figured out a way to manually install Minecraft on their school chromebooks harddrives so that we can't block them with the school filter.

They've gone around sharing the same setup with all their friends.

The kids are alright. They get it. 

I looked at it the other day and the kid who did it looked at me and I just said......""Impressive. And the school can't filter this?""

Kid: ""No.""

Me: ""Nice. I disapprove....but well done.""",Mahaloth,7,2025-04-04 19:23:00

Never the less Mr Healy was amazing. 

Besides being a generally cool like this all the time, he somehow remembered so many kids’ names despite there being so many of us. And even if you didn’t know him, you could approach him and talk to him about anything. He couldn’t always help directly and would send you in the right direction of a councilor or whatever.

She is not one of my students but we have developed a greeting over time that we never discussed or worked out. She just kind of kept adding things on when I see her at this one time of day. But at this point it goes like this..

1. She starts a little cheer where she does the old “Give me a Y! Give me an E! Give me an S!”
2. While she does this I spell the letters out with my arms YMCA style. 
3. She finishes with “What’s that spell?!” and I shout back “YES!”
4. I then take her hand and she does one little spin like she’s a ballroom dancer. 
5. When her single spin is over we give each other a deep, respectful bow and then continue on our separate ways.

I know that choosing to take the harder route, when life gets super tough, can feel a very thankless task; but from someone at 589 days, I promise you that it's a battle worth fighting. 

This may be something you've already learned in therapy but I thought I'd stick it in here in case it helps anyone else...

Learn to treat suicidal thoughts & ideation like clouds. Allow them to float in & out without engaging with them. Don't freak out that they're there (I'll prob still have them for the rest of my life), they're only errant thoughts & they will float on by before you know it. 

Huge congrats OP. My inbox is always open to you or anyone else having a wobbly moment.

It was from when I was struggling in school and she sent me some money to hire a tutor. She shared some of her struggles in school and said she would always find more if I needed it. 

I’ve kept the letter all these years, it’s been over 25, I think, since she sent it. She’s been gone for so long but that letter brought her back and filled me with a deep sense of being loved again. 

My wife and I are expecting our first child in September and I just hope that I can be as giving and supportive as my parents and grandparents were. I worry I won’t be able to give as much as my family gave to me, but it won’t be for a lack of trying.

When I nap, my big orange cat often naps with me, on the far corner of my bed.  At some point, he will get up, walk over and put his paw on my chest (with or without claws) and softly say.... ""mew.""  then turn around and go back to his corner and back to sleep.

I happened to have multiple alarms in the morning in case I didn’t wake on the first one, and they each had different sounds. On the fourth one was when I fed the cats, so they learned to only get hyped for food for the fourth alarm. That made me realize how the alarms could be useful, so I have a separate one with a different sound set at night for them to get treats. Part of the motivation, too, was that if I can’t find the cats easily, I can play the treat alarm and they come running to the same spot.",None,3,2022-09-23 14:23:18

Everyone who thinks Ramsay is an asshole in his shows might be surprised to find out that not long ago this was the NORM in kitchens and that he himself was trained by asshole numero uno.

MadeMeSmile,VLC is great,1hzjpy8,m6qbv6w,"I love VLC. It is one of the first pieces of software that get installed on any fresh install of Windows.

Now that I've said that and since this topic is about VLC, I'm gonna tell you all something. For this to work you need a gpu that is at least Nvidia 10th gen but I'm not sure if it works on all of the cards. It is about Super Resolution, Nvidia's AI upscaling. Don't expect it to work well on really low resolution videos but anything that is 720 or 1080 it makes them so much better, especially if the bitrate isn't that good. I wouldn't expect much out of something like a bluray 1080p remux or something like that.

Just open VLC, go to tools, preferences, enable all settings in the bottom left, scroll down to video > output modules, select Direct3d11 video output, hit the arrow to the left of output modules in the menu, select direct3d11, change video upscaling mode to super resolution, save.

Now whenever you watch something through VLC the GPU will upscale the video using AI and the image is so much better as long as it meets the requirements of what I stated earlier. You could even try on lower resolution stuff but if the quality is really low it can look weird.

Make sure to disable this if you are watching something high quality. I'm hoping VLC adds in an option to enable/disable this quickly in the future.",Dave-C,65,2025-01-12 11:43:12

Meanwhile VLC doesn't care what format the video is in, if it's a video it'll play it. The fact that these guys refuse to stop being open source and not earning any money is just a cherry on top.

MadeMeSmile,This made my day.,rbae7u,hno2d2b,"I’ve been a Doordash driver for several years. We only take pictures of the food when the customer requests contactless delivery. The purpose of contactless delivery is to stop the spread of covid. Yet, during the pandemic, there were several times where my customer would ask for contactless delivery, but then they would open the door immediately after I show up. And of course they would never have a mask on. I’m vaccinated now, but before the vaccines were available, this irritated me to no end. You can’t wait an extra FIVE seconds for your driver to take a picture of the food and walk away, to ensure the safety of your driver? We’re doing dozens of deliveries a week. Each one is a chance to get us sick. This picture isn’t funny, it’s disgusting.
