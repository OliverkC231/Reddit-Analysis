There’s two answers to your questions. 

The first is that “price gouging” is more of a subjective term than an objective term. People will throw around the term price gouging when they feel that someone is charging an unreasonable price. Objectively, the “correct price” is any price in a range of prices. The lowest possible price is the lowest price what a seller is willing to sell for, and the highest price is the maximum willingness to pay by the consumer. Arguably and controversially, prices for hand sanitizer should be higher because aggregate willingness to pay for hand sanitizer has increased. This is strictly the economics of the situation. Obviously, economics does not capture everything that is going on and ethics can help us fill the gaps. That ethical consideration, “even if economics says the price should be $X, morals tell us it should be lower” is why people call it “price gouging.” And, clearly, pharmaceuticals are held to a different standard. But, there seems to be no objective moral facts, so what the ethical thing to do in the two situations could be different and depend on context, social pressures, expectations, current standards, etc. 

The second answer is that there is a very good reason why pharmaceutical companies charge huge markups in many drugs. Basically, these companies spend millions, sometimes billions, of dollars and many years on research and development us new drugs. Once they have spent this huge fixed cost, they can often manufacture the drug for quite cheap. However, they need to recoup the costs of R&D. Imagine if you spent that much time and money on something and weren’t compensated for it (see r/choosingbeggars for how, correctly, upset people get when they don’t get paid $20 for their work). So, typically drug companies are given patents where they basically have a monopoly over that drug for a few decades. The idea is that they can recoup their costs and make a fair profit. Once the patent expires, the drug can be made by anyone and prices tend to fall quite rapidly. If we didn’t allow companies to sell at such a high markup for a short time, a lot less drugs would be developed. Now we could argue that pharmaceutical companies out to discover drugs out of the goodness of their hearts. But be honest with yourself, do you really think that would work? Of course not. 

In short, there is a disconnect between how we think people ought to act and how they actually do. Moreover, there’s different ethical standards people hold given societal pressures, social norms, and context of the situation. Lastly, we know there plate good reasons for pharmaceutical pricing, which is why few people get as upset. 

TLDR - price gouging is subjective. Drug researchers and companies gotta get paid for their work. Ethics is hard",Fat_Je5u5,5,2020-03-19 19:21:16

Basically republicans tended not to believe the documents, while Democrats did.   The Democrats heavily downvoted comments that disbelieved the allegations or that supported Trump.    Republicans heavily downvoted comments that attacked Trump.

The republican downvoters were outnumbered by the democrat downvoters.   Sick of constantly being downvoted below 0, the Trump supporters/republicans left r/politics.   

Despite being progressive myself, I regard the one sided echo chamber that was left in r/politics as dangerous and toxic.   

For one thing, no one left in r/politics saw the Trump win coming, despite the Trump win showing up in the polls if you actually took into account the stated margin of error.  

For another thing, the echo chamber has left hundreds of thousands of people unable to de-escalate political arguments  long enough to have a civil conversation long enough to *understand* why people are on the other side.

This is old and the claims against trump are not substantiated by any evidence. 


If trump was one of the pedophiles the partisan and corrupt FBI would have leaked epstien documents they picked up after he was arrested and after he was murdered. 


Also if there was tangible evidence, epstien would have struck a deal to save his own life and to avoid prison time. Our justice system would have made any deal if it meant bringing trump down, it doesnt exist, best they could come up with is bullshit fake Russia hysteira and nonsense about quid pro quo...

Nobody prepared me for that. I basically stopped doing homework and just played when I got home from school. Rather than just making up that hour or so, I didn't feel like my need for play was satisfied unless I basically did no homework. I was lucky to have graduated high school.  
  
When I got my first job (in highschool), I discovered that I would not have summer breaks... no more being out camping for a week at a time. No more sleeping in late most days. I began laying around in bed whenever I had free time. During the school year, this meant I would go to bed when I got home.  
  
When I started working as an adult, I discovered that there would be many weekends when I would work, or my friends would work, so our days off would not match up. I feel lonely as an adult, and get drunk on my weekends. I have a wife, now, so it isn't so bad as binge drinking alone...  
  
But now that I'm married, I get no alone time, and I often have housework to do on my time off from school (I'm a full-time student). I put off my housework and homework when I am alone so that I can have the break I need... but the breaks I take are too long or too often, and I'm struggling to get my work done.  
  
I stay up too late to make up for lost time, and take too long of naps to make up for lost sleep. I play too much minecraft because I have to satisfy my desire to play before my wife gets home...

The only way I broke that cycle was to go to bed early, wake up early, and make the most of the time before going in to work or school.

I thought I was a night owl, but mostly it was that I was always waking up tired from staying up wasting time all night. When I finally turned my life around and started making good choices, I quickly realized one of the best things I could do, and the best way to do the things I *truly* wanted to do (less time spent on sites like Reddit and more time spent working on writing novels) was to make myself go to bed on time and wake up ready to do the work I wanted to do.",action_lawyer_comics,352,2019-08-27 05:15:16

Back in the early days of the internet, people had a preferred search engine. Some used Lycos, others liked AskJeeves or Dogpile. I still remember when someone told me about google and thinking that sounded like a name a baby came up with. Your search engine of choice was a way of saying something about yourself and how you used [The Net](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/BKDTJC/the-net-1995-poster-BKDTJC.jpg), as we sometimes called it. 

The point is, everyone used the internet differently. There were lots of ways to choose and curate your experience. 

Today, the internet is vastly bigger than it was then, with exponentially more content, and what content there is is exponentially more sophisticated and interactive. But our gateways into it are narrower, though fewer, massively popular channels. These channels are also more defined by our peer-group (digital or physical) than they used to be. 

You never learn about fringe content if you only ever check social media sites like Reddit, Twitter, Snapchat, etc, because those people all tend to talk about the same things, as well as seek out content from similar places as you do. The result is a digital experience that feels very insular and contained.

The content is there. People just aren't actively seeking it out as often or in the same ways as they used to.",skepticaljesus,968,2021-01-22 19:52:47

The new institutional Internet is not all bad. I can review and compare the health recommendations for brushing your teeth on the websites for 12 different nations' college of dentists. I can go to a website whose sole purpose is to aggregate viewer reviews of television shows. Nearly ever newspaper around the world can be read online on their own website, sometimes for a fee. There are still tens of thousands of incredibly useful websites, although most of them are run by relatively large players even if we are talking about a university website and not some dude named Maddox's blog.

The main thing that the new internet changed is commercialization. Whether you're one dude with a blog or a company with an ordering catalogue, a major purpose for your website is to probably to gain money. That doesn't apply to literally every site, but it's a lot of them. Facebook allows you to set up easy virtual storefronts if you suck with technology. And so most of the people who are in it for the money attach to one of the major platforms (YouTube, FB, Amazon) that are also in it for the money. They're the ones who pay to advertise, and it does feel like a closed system where you spend time on the main platforms and most of what you see is encouraging you to spend more tie or money on the major platforms. But if you're willing to go off the tracks, there's still so much cool stuff out there. You just won't see it advertised. The word-of-mouth internet has been replaced by the commercial internet.

.... On that last point, it blows my mind that we have created technology to allow anyone anywhere to access anything, copy knowledge, share science and ideas, and the main progress on the internet is how well we have been able to shut that down and make you pay for everything as if you were getting a physical copy of it in your home.

NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else stay up at night because that’s the only time they can be alone?,rypf2x,hrqvx7g,"Yup. And I recently realized it’s because it’s the only time I have the house to myself and it’s quiet. I love my husband, we’ve been married for 27 years, but I wasn’t prepared mentally to be together literally 24/7 yet. After having to work from home when Covid first hit, he’s decided he prefers it over going into the office. We’ve got one adult child moved out, one in college, and another in high school who’s busy and out doing his own thing. So before Covid, I’d have a few hours during the day to do my own thing, or at least be alone. 

I never realized how grating it can be to have someone (even someone you love) around *constantly*. And he’s a genuinely nice person, but a sensitive person - so if I tell him I’d prefer he go into the office a couple days of the week, I think it would actually hurt his feelings. 
I know there are worse things in the world to complain about. But some days everything he does just irritates the hell out of me.

Take a long look at your friend, and you’ll see more than this as the issue. His views might be the same as they were in high school (never matured), he may be terrible with finances, his hygiene, or his time. He also might be controlling or have anger issues he refuses to resolve. Listen to how he talks about women, or people with authority over him, or those who disagree with him. 

Women his age want stability, maturity, and someone who seeks to better himself and engage in life in ways that are meaningful to him. They want someone who knows how to communicate and has done work on themselves to be a better version. They will see his red flags. 

This girl can’t protect herself properly. Even when it’s “legal” she will be a victim. She can’t see the red flags. 

She may fall for the “older dude” if she has low self esteem or a tough life. But there’s also a good chance she has friends who will support her and the wherewithal to tell HR if he pursues her and makes her uncomfortable.

In your friend's case (35/2 +7 = 24), anyone below 24 starts putting him into creepy territory.  So, 17 or 18, definitely creepy.

Also, google ""ephebophilia"" sometime.  An 80 yo and a 30 yo is in ""meh, they're adults"" territory.  But, when one of the two is still transitioning to adulthood...

&#x200B;

Many people here think 18 year olds aren't adults. I was in the military when I was 18, I was having sex... I am now 34 and would gladly have sex with a hot 18 year old. I was different then to who I am now, but having sex with someone I choose was very much within my capabilities even then, among being responsible with life and death situations. I don't think society has changed that much in the time that 18 year olds are children now (but that is possible I guess). They don't think about making a family or a business so having a relationship with such a young adult is weird but having sex with one? Not a problem. As long as everyone know this is a hook up your friend isn't weird for trying to get some. Are you sure you're not jealous of him? 

If she looks like a woman (and some 18 year olds do) and is into him - it's for sure ok to go for it.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do people wear shoes in the house?,aqwf3q,egj24lu,"So. First, at home I have slippers and I love my nice comfortable slippers. 

But, I see a lot in here about ""clean carpets"" which makes me wonder if people realize that they're really not THAT clean. My socks get laundered after wearing them once and my feet are washed every time I shower. But, how often is a carpet laundered? I'm not just talking a vacuuming, I'm talking as fresh and clean as the socks I'm wearing. Weekly? I doubt it? Monthly? Probably not. Maybe yearly. Maybe.

Now, people want me to remove my shoes so that my nice clean socks and feet inside them go walking on someone's carpet that hasn't been laundered since last year (if ever)? That doesn't seem to me to make sense. 

If people provide a place to put my shoes and prefer I go without them, I will. It's their house and I'll do as they please. But man, don't make it out like it's gross or something. It's the opposite.",jet_heller,29,2019-02-15 14:04:21
NoStupidQuestions,Why do people wear shoes in the house?,aqwf3q,egj3m5v,"I'm American, from Georgia.

This is a fascinating conversation! Ok, in warmer weather I wear sandals most of the time and my shoes come off almost immediately when I come inside.

In colder weather though, I leave my shoes ON inside until I'm ready to sit down and relax. I have hardwood floors so they can be chilly, but honestly, until I'm ready to stop running around, I don't even think about removing my shoes.

If I'm home all day, I wouldn't bother putting shoes on at all though, just going barefoot or wearing socks.

If I go to someone else's home, I would not take my shoes OFF unless they mentioned it because that seems a little too informal and disrespectful. Maybe it's silly but I feel like showing my socks to people I hardly know is a bit too casual?

I should add, I work in a professional environment. If I wear shoes somewhere that gets them dirty like hiking, strawberry picking etc, the shoes would come off as soon as I walked in the door so as not to spread dirt all over the house. I think that is common of most people who have shoes used in a more utilitarian way.

Eventually, as automation & efficiency improve, we will find fewer and fewer available blue collar jobs. & this is the argument for UBI (Universal Basic Income)

Every human being has a right to ""exist"" (food, shelter, water, clothing, health care, basic utilities) & this is where UBI comes in, it covers the basics.

Someday, (if we aren't already there) taxing those in our society who have benefited the most from the riches of our country, will be able to pay for this UBI.

Some people (probably a lot of people) will be lazy asses and will sit around and do nothing and waste their life. (who cares about them)

SOME people, want ""more"" than the basic essentials, want a fancy car, or something, since people don't NEED to work blue collar jobs, they will receive higher pay.

Some people (and this I think is the most exciting), will be aspiring people who will be free to pursue their interests which could lead to an explosion of invention/discovery. In the past, a lot of these people were stuck flipping hamburgers.

Bootstrap theory is based on the idea that as long as YOU can individually rise up out of the poor class, that's OK. It is complicit in the fact that capitalism requires poverty as long as the individual can theoretically pull themselves out of said poverty.

It's basically cruel propaganda to stop you from rising up against the injustices the system is designed to inflict.

This is also why the label socialism as a bad word and push back against social programs of all kinds. Social programs like social security, medicare, unemployment, SDI, UBI, are designed to reduce the suffering under capitalism. It is a correction to the default state of cruelty.

The issue here is first of all, there is WAY too much emphasis on the fact that people need a college degree. Trade schools are a wonderful thing - there are people who work long, arduous hours, come home smelling terrible, and are extremely happy.

With that said, going to college had a specific purpose years ago, which was in simple terms to become formally educated in order to be ‘qualified’ to be in a certain position (such as a teaching degree or an engineering degree). When the government took over student loans back in the 70s-80s, that was when college became less of a place for formal education and more of a business. Moreover, going to college does NOT in any capacity guarantee a “better” paying job. It may give you a few more opportunities, but if you get a degree that is only useful in a very niche area, you should expect to have a limited number of options. And, to the point of government takeover, you’ll still be in debt just from the way that the loans are designed as well as how much college tuition has gone up in the last 40 years.",TanzerB,88,2021-01-09 22:06:28

This is because the system is broken and only favors a few. We are selfish creatures and our society/system reflects that. We need a new system, built by rare humans who are not selfish. 

Since I was a kid, I've wondered why we have to pay for things like food or water, which are essential to our survival. I live in Canada thankfully, so at least our healthcare is free. No one bats an eye about why healthcare is free (""Of course it should be free!""), but when I ask why other essential things for survival aren't free (very *basic* food, water, shelter and clothing) people say ""Well because those things cost money, we can't enslave people, and people would become lazy if all that stuff was free!"" Um... what? No. Healthcare costs billions of dollars, but we find a way to pay every doctor and nurse. I've always held the opinion that basic things for our survival should be free and easily accessible for all. Things like basic food, water, clothing and shelter to survive. And when I say basic I mean the basics to keep us relatively healthy, nothing fancy. Like ""basic food"" wouldn't include cakes or cookies, but things like potatoes, proteins, vegetables, fruits, etc. Stuff you need to live. Those things should be free. 

But who will pay the workers you ask? Everyone will. We include all those ""free"" things into taxes, therefore *everyone* puts a little into the moneypot so that *everyone* gets what they need. This system actually exists right now, this isn't a new idea. Denmark and Finland have adopted this idea. They have free healthcare and free education (it is illegal for a school to charge tuition in Finland), and the government pays those who have lost (or even voluntarily *LEFT)* their jobs enough money per month to cover the basics for living. I watched a video about a Finnish young adult who didn't like her job, it wasn't bringing her happiness. So she quit and the government paid her $2000/month to take it easy and figure out what she wants to do first and I think she decided to become an artist (because ""starving artists"" isn't a thing there). This is common practice there. Citizens pay higher taxes, but because of that everyone takes care of each other. They don't mind paying more because they see it as an *investment* into an amazing future and way of life. Homelessness doesn't exist there either. On top of that, every profession is respected. People treat you the same if you're a doctor vs a garbage man, because they realize that every job is valuable and important. Large wage gaps don't exist. A doctor makes more than a garbage man, but not by a ridiculous amount. And the thing is, in places like Denmark and Finland, you don't even *need* a job that pays a lot. There's no need to make a lot of money, because everything you need to live a good life is already provided for you. Your job is just added income and something for you to enjoy doing.

In future societies, I believe this way of life will eventually be common practice. And they will look back at *our* time the same way *we* look back at the way of life back in the 1800s or 1900s, and feel bad about how difficult our lives must have been (and then be grateful they don't live in *our* time, where we had to actually *PAY* for things we needed to survive!!

If you disagree, you are actively advocating that some people should suffer just “because it’s bad job,” as if that’s their fault.",BAN_SOL_RING,9,2021-01-09 23:47:27

Economies and market systems don't work that way in reality. 
If we had adjusted minimum wage in step with inflation (as we were supposed to do) we would be much better off. The minimum wage expanded our markets and our general economy. Both in terms of growth and development. People were more wealthy, were healthier, held higher expectations for quality of life, and invested more in themselves and their communities. The bizarre zero-sum model you're asking about derives from 'trickle down economics' which is a tool invented to deceive the masses. (It's only useful for making the rich richer and creating wage slaves).
Want people to do tedious or unpleasant jobs? Pay them better. Paying better wages does not result in increases in pricing.
Economies work better when there are no poor people. Citizens are, after all, the paying customers that make an economy exist.

Yes, in the way that jobs like janitors, cashiers, and so forth are going to be necessary in at least some capacity for at least the foreseeable future.  No, in the way the phrase of ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" is meant to be insulting and its meant to be disparaging, because its clearly something that *you* have done wrong.  It isn't that you're being underpaid as a cashier, you hear about people like Jeff Bezos who made Amazon all on his own in his mother's garage!

Except he was given $200,000 of seed money because both his parents were bankers and had a nice fat nest egg.  

The problem is not the people, it is the jobs.  They simply do not pay enough, [this is where a minimum wage job pays for housing and how many hours of work are needed.](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/505093/make-minimum-wage-heres-how-many-hours-you-need-work-week-afford-one-bedroom-apartment)  That's also just cost of living, it doesn't take into account healthcare or emergency expenses.  This is done on purpose to facilitate something known as ""Wage theft.""  The more you cut costs for ""unskilled work,"" which is an oxymoron, since all jobs will take at least some skill to do in some way.  An electrician is a skilled job, as is road paving, construction, and even yes, being a janitor.

We simply don't pay poor people enough despite having a gargantuan glut of wealth that just...doesn't move anywhere.  There's literally no other reason, except the people at the tippy top are so greedy that they refuse to pay their employees the worth of what they actually produce.",None,4,2021-01-10 00:22:48

NoStupidQuestions,Anybody else feel super cringey when taking selfies and therefore take none?,gjqcou,fqmuj1z,"Think about this. A lot of us live away from our families, and selfies is a way to keep far away family members up to date, ya know?

Also, memories. One day, we won't be around anymore. If you never have pictures of yourself, what are your children or remaining family members going to hang on their wall for rememberance? 

Not ever taking any pictures at all is, in and of itself, a somewhat selfish act. My wife never let's me take her picture, and it drives me crazy.

Not all selfies are cringe, nor is the mere act of taking one. If your taking pictures of yourself 10 times a day, yeah, you're overdoing it. But here and there? Nah. There's good reason to take selfies.

Let's not forget the historical selfies, which required people to stand still for hours while they were painted. What sounds more cringe and narcissistic?

NoStupidQuestions,Why do my students call me a goat?,vm3cjd,ie1qlo5,"**Hoax alert! Please, hear me out before downvoting me, and if you still do, please at least offer a rebuttal**

I don't doubt that you're a teacher, or your students said this to you, there's no reason to.

But there is almost no chance that this post is not ""karma whoring"".

Firstly, your account is **five days old...** **Jackpot!**

Of course it could be a throw away account, but if it were, you'd probably mention it. But also, you've made several posts completely unrelated to this topic before this one, so you didn't create it just to ask this question. It would be less suspicious if this were your first post, instead of the 7th or 8th.

Your post is **precisely** the perfect blend of sweet naiveté mixed with being oblivious that you're a wonderful person that presses all of reddit's feely buttons. Just look at those awards! It's almost like it was intended to do exactly that...

Also, excellent reddit etiquette with the edits, **it's almost like you've been here much longer.**

You say they call you **""a goat""** in the title and then switch to **""the goat""** in the text, which are obviously not the same thing. Indefinite vs definite articles are not something people generally confuse. Being called a goat could have  multiple meanings, being called ""the goat"" has one, and is easily found with a quick search.

They've said it all year and you're just wondering now what it means? Also, all year, none of the 20-30 13 year olds slipped up and said what it meant? Was this orchestrated? Why didn't they tell you, anyway? Surely they'd want you to know.

**Why didn't you ask anyone around you in the real world before asking reddit? Why didn't you google it?** Googling (or duckduckgo, etc) ""the goat meaning"" brings up ""greatest of all time"" as a search suggestion before you even hit enter. Urban dictionary exists, and this definition is in there.

**Another of your (very few) posts even details advanced knowledge of search engine usage.**

>""I couldn't find any matches when reverse searching for mine either.  
>  
>There are advanced reverse image searching services out there (that you pay for) but I don't know if I want to use them.""

I highly doubt that your first instinct to find out what being called ""the goat"" means was to post on reddit. a site you've only been using for five days, when you knew a search engine would have answered your question (before you even hit enter), just without all of the attention, praise, awards and dopamine.

**What if it meant something negative/mean/offensive (etc)? You really not going to check that before telling others that  a large number of people you work with has been calling you it for a year..? It might have meant deathly halitosis, or bad combover. Risky!**

Come on Reddit. We've been here before!

Again, I am not saying OP is definitely not a teacher, or that their students definitely didn't call them ""the goat"", or that they didn't know what it meant at  the time and so had to look it up. These are all perfectly plausible.

**What I am saying they almost certainly knew what it meant when they posted it to reddit, for the karma, awards and attention.**

Before anyone calls me envious, I'm writing this because I don't like stolen valour (or usurped awards) or ""karma whoring"", and I don't like emotional manipulation for personal gains.

You may now downvote me to oblivion, though I ask that if you  do, please also take a moment to debunk my points.

I believe  in you, reddit!

Edit: Five days old not two.

Edit 2: Sorry I'm writing like a child, I'm at day 4 ish of a Covid infection and typing with a TV remote keyboard, looking through one eye due to the headache. Also... Positive karma!  Reddit, so pleased to know you can be reasoned with.

Edit 3: **First, thanks for the gold! You truly are the goat.** I'm glad my nerdy ramblings are appreciated. This has got out of hand, have you seen twitter? I would not like to be in OP's position.. twitter is fickle.

Secondly: **Come on, down voters, I challenged, even begged you to debunk my points, not just click and move on! This post has reached 25 about 5 times now, the positive score won't hide you! Won't even one of you speak?**",proximalfunk,55,2022-06-28 12:40:29

NoStupidQuestions,"Today, I told my mom that I have no internal monologue and she stared at me like I have three heads. Is having one common?",exan65,fg7ioby,"This whole thread is making me super confused.

Firstly, about internal monologues, do people actually spell out sentences like ""no, I shouldn't do that"", for example, in their head? I do have sort of a voice in my head while typing or reading, but the only thing it does is narrate the words. I don't form my thoughts into actual sentences, because that just seems like a waste of time. The voice only happens as a translation from my abstract thoughts to language (or the other way around) when I need to. (This is also how I classify ""knowing"" a language. If I am unable to form the sentences directly into the language, and it is interrupted by a better known language, I am not yet sufficient in it.) However, I do sometimes get music stuck in my brain, so I have that imaginary audio.

&#x200B;

There was a thread about the similar situation with mental images. I don't actually ""see"" anything when visualizing, however the thought is there. I don't describe the images in words either, it's just there, with no actual form, abstract. So, I feel like the question to those who claim to see images is: does closing your eyes actually help you picture something? For me it makes no difference whether or not they're open, as my ""mental image"" ""looks"" nothing like an actual image. It's just...super abstract. And, I don't consider myself to have any particular problems with creativity, since I enjoy drawing and painting quite a lot.",None,50,2020-02-01 21:44:17

Besides if you don't tlak to yourself in your head, no offense but I can't imagine how thought processes, or intelligence would be for you.  Majority of problem solving is done using internal monologue.  Without it.. you're walking around like a zombie or a 'vegetable state' person.

But I always said I wasn’t really a cat guy. Then I had some health issues leading into the pandemic. My mom got me a cat to keep me company because I was stuck at home all the time. When we went to the shelter, he was just sitting still in his cage with his eyes closed, seemingly content. I saw him and asked the attendant if we could see him. She opened the cage and he came up to me and sniffed my hand and rubbed his face on my hand. I moved closer to the cage and he leaned up against my chest and purred while I pet him. So of course he was the one. 

Two years later, he follows me around my apartment always sitting next to me. At night when I climb into bed he will be hanging out in the living room while I browse my phone. As soon as I put my phone down and turn off the light, I flip to my right side. Every night since I’ve had him, he runs and jumps into my bed and lays down next to my chest, head resting on my arm. He will lay there until I fall asleep. Every morning, when I wake up he will hear me toss in my bed and run and jump in my bed to greet me. In an otherwise dynamic world that is always changing, he’s been the one constant keeping me grounded.

So yeah, I do that too.

1st three are the day we found her. We were driving in the dark and hit what we thought was a possum. Got home and heard MEOWWWWWW coming from my front bumper. Turned out there was a whole entire cat wedged in between the plastic grill and the radiator. She used up one of her 9 lives that day for sure because she was scared but not hurt.

She was REALLY skinny and seemed grateful that we found her. We took her to the vet right away. She had a broken fang and fleas, but no microchip, and nobody had posted her in the local missing pet groups.

We paid for her shots and flea treatment, and brought her home. She gained about two pounds in ten days, and we got her chipped as soon as she had enough meat on her bones. She is super cuddly and affectionate, and I am her favorite person and it makes me so happy to have her.

I was her second foster home and took her in just after her leg had healed, and just before her mouth had finished healing.  And I couldn't give her up. 

I look at her while she sleeps and I'm so grateful to have her, and it gives me such peace knowing that she's not living on the street and she's all fixed up.  I get so sad thinking about all the pain and discomfort she's had in her life, and it brings me such joy to see her at peace.

NoStupidQuestions,"How come governments can be so openly corrupt, everybody knows it, a lot ridicule it, yet nothing ever happens?",ia3bsn,g1k1ps0,"Since everybody is going Looney Tunes, I'll try my best to be real. 

Some countries have rulers. The people don't choose them and have no say. That's an easy one to figure out. 

Other countries, the ones I assume you're talking about, elect their leaders. 

In places where leaders are elected, rich people and businesses use their money to support the campaigns of the people who are beneficial to their interests. 

Also, people, in general, don't know shit about politics, and don't care. They find a group that agrees with them on a few things that are important to them, and that's what they vote for. 

Those groups usually have a few very agreeable positions to earn votes, and they have many fucked up positions to continue to earn money from donations. 

Because of all this, the organization can continue to rake in money and receive support, while actively working against the majority of their supporters.

NoStupidQuestions,"How come governments can be so openly corrupt, everybody knows it, a lot ridicule it, yet nothing ever happens?",ia3bsn,g1kqm0v,"I'm from Kenya, and if I may be honest, majority of the population here do not understand the functions of government e.g. the different arms and their roles. Most, I believe, don't even understand why we have a government in the first place. I can't blame them because the way governments are structured post-colonization is different from how we organized ourselves in our small tribal, societies pre-colonization.

Most of the people look at politicians as celebrities and don't even hold them accountable for failures related to their job descriptions. Instead, most care about their wealth, tribe and popularity. We currently have an MP who was caught by CCTV cameras inside a club (_which had been shut down but this is another different story on its own_) shooting the DJ after an argument ensued. The video made rounds on news media outlets and social media, but nothing is yet to be done. He still holds his sit as MP and even streams live on social media to tutor kids who are currently at home because of the pandemic, on various subjects. The DJ survived, but is currently paralysed from his neck downwards.

Now, you may wonder how this man is still MP with a video of him attempting murder doing the rounds. I wonder too. A lot of Kenyans wonder this too. However, he still freely roams around his constituency meeting his constituents who seem to still adore him & even mingles with / hangs around ""powerful"" politicians e.g. his party leader and even the president (at political rallies pre-corona).

See, you might think that the most important thing to ALL Kenyans should be having a functional government void of corruption, that works in our favour to improve our quality of life. 

However, you'd be surprised by how, with a huge, illiterate, tribalistic population, these basic expectations no longer matter and that MOST Kenyans just don't care about things beyond their tribes, cultures and religion when it comes to government and holding government officials accountable.

I can't explain it in simple words because there are so many things that go into it, but what I can say is, you'd think fighting corruption would be at the top of the list for most citizens, right? Well, I'm sorry to say, but it just isn't.",None,178,2020-08-15 12:07:22

NoStupidQuestions,"How come governments can be so openly corrupt, everybody knows it, a lot ridicule it, yet nothing ever happens?",ia3bsn,g1l4lgh,"I can only speak for the US but here's what I've gathered:
1. Most people only vote every 4 years, in the Presidential election. There are midterms (deciding federal and state senators/representatives, some state governors, state proposals etc) every 2 years, and there are also local elections every year (city and county elections for positions like Mayor, sheriff, treasurer, councilmen, and local proposals like millages or new ordinances). This causes problems because the president unfairly bears the weight of every american's happiness in every facet of their life, despite the president actually having fairly little control over how cities or states handle a given problem. Nothing changes locally because *no one votes locally*
2. The majority of voters are not wealthy. Many people in this country have to work overtime or work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They also have to manage all the other aspects of their lives (kids, parents, bills, medical issues, the broken dishwasher) and unfortunately there isn't very much time left to stand in line at the polls and cast a ballot, let alone research candidates and proposals to ensure you're voting in your best interest. 
3. For many positions, there are no term limits. This means that a person can hold office for *decades*. We often worry about what good/bad things a president can do for the country in 2 term (8 years total), but we think nothing of the senator or representative that's been in office for 24 years. The lack of term limits in addition to the practice of voting for names that we recognize causes elected officials to become content and comfortable in their position; they know that the likelihood of them getting voted out is low. They have no real incentive to make lasting changes. 

There's a lot I'm probably leaving out, but these are IMO 3 of the biggest reasons.

To overthrow such a regime one needs several things, most (if not all) of which is easily corrupted or disabled by the regime:

- a majority of population ready for action - divide and conquer works amazingly easy and well

- leaders - some can be corrupted, some can be smeared, some are even installed by the regime

- organization - with two above this is a no brainer

So, basically, if you control the media, thus being in the position to misinform and affect public opinion it's really easy. It helps when general education is low but that takes time.
Police is useful but that's last resort.

You actively fight for freedom 24/7.

You might not see it in your day to day life but your day to day in a free country is part of that fight by living the free life.

Freedoms are generally curtailed by the economic planning of totalitarian governments when their predicted numbers don't correspond to reality. So they blame reality and not their plans and  attempt to restrict freedoms in order to direct the numbers to resemble the economic planning. The more they constrain you the more they can predict outcomes. Hence why the free market is so important.

When they economically collapse and can't feed half the middle class to oppress the other half it then falls apart.

People are saying the root of the problem is ""because the system allows for lobbying"" or ""because the government is corrupt,"" which are both unfortunately 100% true. 

The only thing wrong with these statements is that they are not addressing root problems, they are addressing outcomes of the root problems.

The problems are not the rules (lobbying and loopholes) but the mindsets that still exist with us today that led to the creating of the shitty rules.

People are so mesmerized by luxury/getting rich that we are all are willing to try to get rich with everything we've got! The majority of Americans (without pushback) work unapologetic 9-5 jobs, gamble in the lottery, we defend our billionaires publicly with ""he earned his money,"" we vote based on our economy instead of our cumulative quality of life, i mean shit dude besides Dubai there is nowhere on earth that caters as well on such a big scale to rich people. And the reason so many people are still defending this shit is because they wanna be rich and powerful too, so they won't trash the guys who already are!

You and I living our lives based around money is what is creating the society that breeds greedy corruption like that in our government.

The problem is less that the rules are forcing us into a corner, it is moreso us that are doing it to each other by blindly chasing our desires for power and greed. The politicians corrupting our system at the top are our friends, family, and neighbors, meaning YOUR friends families and neighbors could be corrupted too if given political power, and probably much easier than you'd imagine.

I think the solution these days is not to try to enact change by again changing the rules, but to plan to eventually change the rules to reflect an improved society - we need to change each other and ourselves before anything ever truly changes for humanity. We have got to talk each other out of wanting to be rich and powerful, we've gotta get rid of that twinkle in our eyes for cokparative superiority, and we have to realize that us as a human species is more important than any of us individually.

We also have one of the worlds lowest level of corruption. This social system comes with other benefits too; no one pays for medical expenses, educations arent just free, students receive a monthly income. And yes the level of education is also ranking high. I fail to see why this type of system is not demanded by all people if not for the benefits, then perhaps for the low level of corruption.

I am not saying there isn’t any corruption at all. Usually though when it happens, our news agencies have a tendency to make sure it gets the people’s attention, maybe because we are not bombarded constantly by insignificant idiocracy and our laws actually demand all news to be fact checked and unbiased.

I truly love traveling and meeting people in any country, however it’s demoralizing to see how some struggle under the weight of their leaders ability to bleed their country for personal benefits or in the interests of friends and/or corporations. I am not all to optimistic on this part, but it would be great to one day see a world where governments are truly for the people, by the people within this path we’ve chosen of capitalism. Guess though morals have always been for sale - just a matter of figures being high enough and it makes sense in some ways since we all strive for just a little bit better, though some will never be satisfied.

This time around a new way of corruption seems to have taken hold, which is that when a leader is openly corrupt but uses peoples own identity against them. Like if your a democrat then to the republicans all you do is spread lies and vice versa. In-between these lines a leader and anyone in power is free to do whatever as the people are too busy to fight over who is right and who is wrong. Maybe not a new tactic but it is utilized to the extreme and it really works perfectly.

Edit: sry for the rant! To answer your question I believe corruption is part of any society and would claim it usually sits at an level tolerated by it’s inhabitants. Maybe someone will dispute this? It’s an inherent part of having power and can be an effective tool to both get and keep high ranking positions. Most people either feel too low a status to do much or too comfortable to engage or for a small percentage they benefit and thus have a reason to keep the current structure. This is also why most demonstrators are usually young university students, who are idealistic, not burden with materialistic needs or too comfortable in family, loans, jobs and such.

Politicians are people like you and me: they grew up, studied in some university, tried to find a government job and ended up where they are now. Everyone of you could be a politician.

What does that mean? It means that we are all corruptible because it's within human nature to be and as soon as you have a position of power, you will be corrupted as well. Period.

There is a minority of people that are virtually incorruptible, and those are kept far from power by the corrupt majority. Or killed, eventually.

We all know that, yet we vote for the next corrupt leader hoping he'll accidentally defend our interests while taking care of his own.

This system exists because we protect it and endorse it. How to solve this problem? You can't. Democracy it's unavoidably a corrupting mechanism.

If you stick to the liberal ideological framework, which you get taught in school (capitalism is good, competition is good, individuals exist, political representation works, nations exists, property is good, hierarchy is natural, greed is good, your are free,...) you simply cannot imagine to lead your own life or that change is possible at all. You stick to the status quo and it's behavioral programs, try to get the best piece of the cake you can get and just are a mindless cog in the wheel. 

News flash: Liberalism (the ideology (which includes all flavors of the american electoral politics (you to republicans!), not what US-americants call liberalism) is utter and total bullshit. It's a philosophical framework which fuses together the most incoherent bullshit some people could think of to secure their privileges (Hobbes, Keynes, Smith). All it's basic tenets are lies and have been proven wrong by science (or by philosophy in the case of philosophical questions). 

* There are no individuals, see Nietzsche and the whole science of psychology
* Hierarchy is not natural, see anthropology especially Graebers work on Madagassean ""anarchy"", Herrschaftsfreie Institutionen Texte zur Stabilisierung staatsloser, egalitärer Gesellschaften by Rüdiger Haude, Thomas Wagner
* Cooperation is natural - see Mutual Aid by Peter Kropotkin, or alternatively basic evolution (hint: symbiosis is the basis of complex live forms , humans got domesticated by wheat and trees form an ""internet"" of root networks and help each other)
* Property or rather the concentration of it led to the collapse of every empire EVER. (See history or What is Property? by Pierre Joseph Proudhon and Debts: the first 5000 years by David Graeber) Humanity lived 99% of its existence in usufruct (the total absence of property) up until 5000 years ago. 
* Political representation is running in circles, social struggles are fighting for the same rights they fought 100 years ago 
* Capitalism destroys the basic foundations of live on this planet, not just climate, deforestation, acidity of the oceans, monocultures (lets wait till the phosphor runs out in 20  years, looking forward to global starvation) and urbanization turn the planet into an unlivable hellhole (for proof see science)
* Freedom as defined by liberal nation states is simply put the right to own property and the property of your mind (you also do not exclusively own your body, as you sell it in wage labor). This in itself is a tautological formulation like ""you get wet when it rains""
* nations and nation states have not existed 400 years ago. The first one was the US, previous empires were all multicultural and multi-ethnic",None,5,2020-08-15 15:30:41

NoStupidQuestions,"How come governments can be so openly corrupt, everybody knows it, a lot ridicule it, yet nothing ever happens?",ia3bsn,g1m975s,"I’m Filipino and the government there is probably one of the most governments. I was born there and moved to America when I was 10 so living in two very different countries gives me a unique perspective. 

I think corruption in the Philippines is so bad because it’s part of the culture. I’ve noticed that a lot of Filipinos don’t have respect for authority. People generally don’t follow the rules. People never come on time, people litter everywhere, skipping lines is normal, cops aren’t feared, people build houses on the sidewalks, etc. 

Now on to the government itself. When someone is a politician, it means they’re rich rich. And the longer they’ve been in politics, the richer they get. Why? Because for every funding they all get cuts. This starts at the very top and trickles down to the lowest positions. Even then, for congress/senate, the lawmakers don’t really get a say in what they decide. They have to agree to their party because if they don’t they wouldn’t have been able to run in the first place. They also would get funding taken away from them which means they lose all the money they spent on elections.

And speaking of elections, you know vote-buying? It’s a literal term in the Philippines where people line up and receive money from candidates in exchange for a promise of their vote. This means that only those who are wealthy can run for office. Imagine in my hometown, which is a smaller developing city. The winning candidate for governor spent $17 million, and donations never count much usually,in just one election to win. And he earned it back in less than a year.... That’s an incredible amount of money especially in pesos. 

And those wealthy politicians? Well their children are succeeding them. It’s extremely common to have family members in other positions for the same area. This ensures that they continue the “family business.” Politicians and their families are seen as royalty in their respective areas. They’re followed around by military (usually because they’re extremely wealthy and are targets for kidnapping) and are seen as local celebrities. 

I think one of the main reasons the government system allows itself to be corrupt is that higher ups choose the government workers. For example, the governor is responsible for the public departments (ex education, constructions, hospitals/clinics, etc.) within the province (again imagine it like a state). This means that whenever there’s a new governor, all these positions are wiped out, maybe not completely but can be if the governor decides to. So new teachers, new doctors, new assistants, new everyone. And these people have to be loyal to their governor. Therefore, they have complete control over every decision that needs to be decided. 

So why can governments be openly corrupt? It’s because it is systematically allowed to, at least in the Philippines, due to the complete control politicians have in a giant web of network. Starting from the Congress/senate and president, they have ties to local governments and thus all the public affairs in the smallest minuscule capacity that ensures absolute cooperation and loyalty. This corrupt system has been going on forever and to be in politics means playing in their own game. I personally think there’s no fix in the corruption of the Philippine government. They would have to burn it all down and restart from scratch. 


P. S. I can’t believe I wrote an entire essay on Filipino corruption. I guess I’ve been inspired while being stuck here in the Philippines and having to experience how the government handled the pandemic.",jimmers892,4,2020-08-15 17:05:27

NoStupidQuestions,"How come governments can be so openly corrupt, everybody knows it, a lot ridicule it, yet nothing ever happens?",ia3bsn,g1m3kvq,"Corruption is actually my area of research. There are really a few questions wrapped up in here. One of them is, ""why do people vote for corrupt politicians?"" 

People vote for corrupt politicians for a few reasons. First, they don't know the politician is corrupt. It's one thing to think generally there is a lot of corruption, but another to think that my specific representative is corrupt. This is even more true recently with the decline in the trust in the media. Second, research shows people are less likely to vote for a politicians they know to be corrupt, but it's not the only factor. Would you change your vote in the upcoming US presidential election if you saw prof your preferred candidate had offered government contracts to whichever company gave him a big donation. I wouldn't. I wouldn't like it but I hate the other guy so much it wouldn't switch my vote. Third, people may expect benefits for voting for a corrupt politician. There was a famous Brazilian politician who used to run on the slogan, ""he steals but he gets things done."" We see this more in countries with more clientelistic systems of elections, but the same principal can apply broadly. I don't like that my politicians steals but if he's elected I'll get the new school, or hospital, or tax cut. 

There is also research that shows that corruption essentially turns voters off. If people think there is a lot of corruption they may leave the political process, actually making corruption something of an electoral strategy.

But I think another key answer to the questions is that people get punished for corruption all the time. Yes, there are lots of corrupt leaders, but there are also lots who have been brought down by corruption. Some of the most consistent and long-running authoritarian regimes in the world, (Mexico, Malaysia) were brought down significantly over issues of corruption. The Arab Spring was kicked off by an issue of corruption that toppled the Tunisian government. If you're talking about the US Donald Trump, who is more nakedly corrupt than any president in living memory is currently way way down in the polls. 

Countries also reform themselves all the time. The US has issues with corruption, but nothing compared to a hundred years ago. Look up the corruption issues 70 years ago in most Northern European countries that now do so well.",iamdanthemanstan,3,2020-08-15 16:38:35

In general, it seems kind of crazy that there are problems people know exist, want to fix, and no one one does anything about them. Corruption, homelessness, poverty, even illness, are all something we could remove if we as a society decided to. But we don't.

Part of the issue here is to battle ANY systemetic problem, a lot of people have to act against their own immediate interests. Imagine you're a politician, and you're had it with corruption. You're going to rebel against the lobbyists that prop you up, so you shoot them down. You call out corruption wherever you see it, you try and clean house...and all of the politicians who do have their lobbyist money squash you.

Okay, so you're a politician who wants to combat corruption, and you try telling all the OTHER politicians to band together to combat corruption. If you ALL agree to even the playing field, surely things will get better, right? You have two problems here: One, if some people claim to agree and don't, the ones who are still corrupt will have the resources to crush you. And two, every politician benefits from claiming to be against corruption, even if they aren't. So there's no way to for anyone to tell that you're serious.

In any situation where you need a bunch of people to agree to do something that hurts them slightly to get change it becomes really hard to make progress.

I’d bring about $200 maybe a little more for commissary. Shit can get expensive in there and you won’t have to worry about deadlines to load your account again. 

As far being inside goes

Be prepared to be annoyed. It is very loud in a dorm. A lot of people sleep all day so they’re up all night. The sheriffs deputies will fuck with you. 3 am standing head count, lights on at 6 am, the lights also never fully go out and are usually right above the bunks. Just roll with the bullshit. Don’t let other people spazzing out make you think it’s okay. Expect bullshit so it won’t come as a surprise. 

You’ll have rowdy people in there that like to cause/start shit. You don’t have to be and usually won’t be a part of it if you’re chill and mind your business. If there is a fight, you’ll usually see everyone flocking towards it or start taking laps around the pod to watch. Just go to your bunk. In my county they can charge you for watching fights. In my county you also get an inciting a riot in a penal institution charge for fighting. Fighting a gang member gets you a state R.I.C.O even if you don’t gang bang. You can be scared but don’t look scared. Just breathe and try to relax the muscles in your face. In 30 days there’s inevitably gonna be someone that tries you up. Don’t go for it. Don’t give a speech. Just tell them you’re not here to get into any bullshit, you’re doing your time and getting the fuck on. Carry yourself like a man, don’t be cocky. 

Try to talk with the people a little so most of the pod knows who you are. Pick and choose who you have real conversations with. Pick and choose who you talk to at all and who is more or less co worker status having surface level conversations. 

Best thing for you to do to pass time is gonna be working out. I used to start around noon and go until chow. Eat, shower and play cards until lights out at 11pm. If you’re religious at all, find the people that get the little “daily bread” books or have a Bible, read with them if they’re cool with it or part of a group that reads and discusses it. 

In my county showers only run certain hours of the day. MAKE SURE you are in that rotation both times they run. Everyday. Jail is a dirty ass place and you also don’t want to be one of the people in there smelling like ass. That will get you into some shit. 

Don’t go up to the windows looking into other pods, much as you see it happening. 

People might be in there smoking K2, cheeking pills if they get the mental meds etc. Dont engage. Don’t support anybody doing it. Dont let anybody talk you into it.  Don’t front anybody commissary, don’t gamble. 

Stay away from the 3 Gs. Gays, Gangs and Gambling. Shit ain’t your business. Jail is not a place of tolerance, inside you cannot be cool or associate with the gays even if you do out here. You will be lumped together and ridiculed/outcast the same as them. 

If something happens in the pod like a fight, tattooing etc and they get caught up, don’t say anything to a deputy. Your name is Bennett and you ain in it. 

Make a list of the commissary, the items, their number and the cost. In my county we had to order over the phone and the one sheet with the items was taped on the outside of the pod window. 

Try to pick a good bunk mate. You’ll most likely be in an open dorm so it’s free range pretty much. If it’s a crowded pod, look for an open bunk. People might try to fuck with you and tell you they’re full up and make you sleep on the floor. Don’t go for it. One tiers side is usually for the gang members. So avoid that one pretty much at all times. You hear or see one of em doing some dumb shit, don’t look up there. 

You’re gonna run into a couple psych case ass people. People with no hope that turn it into anger. People that are just plain ol stupid. Some people that are actually pretty cool and just have some really shitty habits. You’re not there to preach to anybody about anything kuz at the end of the day you’re both in jail. 

Jail is jail man. It’s gonna be about as stupid as can possibly be. 30 days doesn’t seem long but it’ll honestly feel like forever sometimes. Try to keep your mind occupied and yourself busy throughout the day. Some days will be better than others. 

Your first 7-10 days will probably be in a transitions pod, to help you get used to the feeling. Eventually a deputy will come in to do placement and see where your permanent dorm is gonna be. You probably won’t be able to order commissary in there but they will give you state soap, toothbrush and paste and a towel. It gets cold in the dorm so try to get a sweater. If a friend you make gets bonded out ask for theirs. 

Also. You’re gonna have trouble shitting. The cool offs (state drink mix) they give you has saltpeter in it and it’ll dry your shit up. Drink a cup or two of warm water throughout at the day and that’ll help. 

If you have any questions about what it’s like just pm me. I think I covered a good base but if not just lmk. Good luck man.

Memorize phone numbers, that sort of thing, so you can ensure consistent communication with your loved ones. If this ain't your first time then you know what to expect, but best of luck, know your rights, try to stay respectful to staff cuz you don't know who's the good cop vs the bad cop, and keep in touch with any loved ones.

Also, I'd check to see if you got anyone who can send you money while you're locked up. Commissary, baskets, anything like that. It's nice to receive the little things like that because jails can be screwed up at times.

I put myself in a mindset of small progress.

So, I take a shower, have a shave. Have breakfast, take the dog out (Not in that order), and continue like this throughout the day. I break up tasks into small chunks and work my way towards that. 

It helps. It's not perfect, and there are days where I do experience markedly lower activity. I'm human and I have a disability, so I have to 'trust in God but tie up my camel', as it were. I can forgive myself, but only if I take the steps to prepare.

Edit: I went to group therapy for CBT with other bipolar folks. One gentleman had lost job, relationship, etc. due to his disability. I still vividly remember the day when he volunteered something in group.

NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone go through a vicious loop of being productive & having a great routine for a few days to living like an absolute slob for the next few... rinse and repeat?,g5yxfb,fo6mmvd,"I do, but it turned out I’m bipolar, autistic, and have ADHD. What this sounds like to me is that you’re having some trouble with being productive - maybe you have something going on like an undiagnosed condition - ADHD, depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, autism, there are lots of conditions that can make it next-to-impossible to be productive and “disciplined,” that people often don’t know they have. But you’re determined, so you *try really hard* and *force yourself* to be productive so you can accomplish your goals and be the kind of person you want to be. But this comes at a price. It requires a much higher cognitive load than it should to be able to make yourself perform under those conditions. You’re having to expend twice the mental and emotional energy to do these things, because you’re working against the cognitive deficits caused by whatever condition you’re struggling against. It could be low dopamine, low norepinephrine, low serotonin, too much cortisol, there are all sorts of things that can go wrong with your brain. 

Because you have to exert an unnatural amount of effort to pull off that level of structure and discipline for a few days, because your brain isn’t really in a healthy state to do it, you soon get worn out and just can’t do it anymore. Now you’ve completely drained all your willpower and mental energy, so you don’t even have any left to do even basic things like bathing, so you live like a slob for the next couple days while you recover. It’s kind of like trying to run a race on a broken leg, then *wondering why you can’t walk at all the next day.*

This has been my *entire life.* I spent my whole life trying so hard to be disciplined. I’d just flip flop from one extreme to the other. I’d give it everything I had and push myself, but since I was working against my ADHD and emotional issues, it took an unnatural amount of effort. Finally I’d just snap and give out. Then I’d be too burned out to do anything for a while. Then repeat the cycle. Then, as an adult, I found out I have ADHD, autism, and bipolar disorder. I never had a chance! I went on medication, which was a huge game-changer. I still struggle, but getting diagnosed and treated was the best thing that ever could have happened to me. It gave me the ability to live a more normal life and do things on a consistent basis I could never do before. 

I would strongly suggest getting screened for ADHD, depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, or autism. Especially with ADHD, there are different types, and not everyone is the stereotypical hyperactive type.

NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone go through a vicious loop of being productive & having a great routine for a few days to living like an absolute slob for the next few... rinse and repeat?,g5yxfb,fo740gn,"For me there’s a couple keys to avoiding that cycle. Since you said you were a slob for 2 days and good for a week, I’ll just say you were 20% bad and 80% good for an example. 
 
(I put a TLDR at the bottom)

First, I don’t try to be 100% good on my goals every day. It’s just not realistic or even possible honestly. That just leads to having 0% successful days when you inevitably burn out and can’t meet your standards. So in a week, I’ll be something like 80-90% good Monday to Friday and then more like 60-80% on the weekends. Obviously you can tighten that up or adjust based on your needs or how well it’s working. I think this helps me form good habits better while you’re still averaging that same 80% of good over time. It’s also easier to improve incrementally starting there. 

Another thing is recognizing urges and either finding alternatives or satisfying them in moderation. You also should plan this out so it’s not a let down. Like when you’re on a diet, I prefer to have a couple dark chocolate chips when I feel like it instead of just totally cutting out chocolate. When I cut it out entirely, the craving just kind of builds and builds until I just have to have some huge dessert. And then it just gets easier and more satisfying to keep doing it. A few chocolate chips a day fights the craving and is less damaging to my overall goals than buying a cake and some ice cream. Similarly, I might notice I’m really craving a cheeseburger or something. Instead of ignoring that, I might say that if I meet my goals all week, I can have a good burger Friday night and cut back a little more than usual the next day or two. Again, I think if you ignore it, it just builds until you break. Now all a sudden you’ve broken down and feel bad about it so you make a whole weekend of eating poorly. 

It works with other things too, I just struggle the most with eating habits. It could be just cleaning most of the kitchen every week instead of making it spotless or simply taking a shower and brushing your teeth every day but not worrying about shaving, putting on makeup or dressing up daily. Then to my second point, if you feel it stressing you out a little, schedule a day later in the week where you know you won’t do any house work or take care of yourself. Try to clean the house just a little more, and maybe get a haircut and mani/pedi or something like that leading up to that day though. 

TLDR: 

1) instead of trying to be perfect daily and then being terrible a couple days, try to be more realistic and manageable - maybe like 80% successful every day. 

2) plan for moments of indulgence when you are struggling instead of ignoring the urges. It feels better when it’s planned instead of a breakdown and you can compensate for those bad moments in the days leading up to them.",eckrueger,3,2020-04-22 16:10:55

I used to go through this all the time. The biggest thing is that having fluctuating days like that kills your progress and momentum

This basic formula will help you to be very successful and avoid this pitfall.

A. You need to have clarity on your end goal or the direction you want to move.

B.  A simple set of  routine items that are written out that you follow on a consistent basis.

C. A way to reflect daily and weekly on what went well and what didn't and to make the adjustments.

if you just do that you'd be surprised how rapidly you start to move forward in basically every area of your life.


##Here is some actionable advice that works for me:

1. write out your goals for the week.

2. Create a morning and evening routine for your work days.  Have it written out or typed out so that you check it off and fill it out each day.  To simplify  I think of it is book ending my days. Therefore regardless of how effective or ineffective my day is in between these two routine items I know that I'm continually moving the ball forward and not letting things fall behind. 

A good morning routine sets the tone for the day and increases the probability of a successful outcome, mood, energy.

A good evening routine make sure we measure our progress for the day and make adjustments going forward.

even a fraction of a single percent improvement per week can double your performance output in 18 months. if you keep the routine like this you will be exponentially ahead of where you are today in 18 months.

Example

##Am routine ( M -F )

- wake up same time

- mental gratitude review. Think about the things you're grateful for and imagine not having them or those who currently don't have them. your health is a great example considering their people right now fighting and dying around the world in hospitals gasping for air

- make bed

- no phone or external stimuli for  30 +minutes

- brain dump on a piece of paper for five minutes to clear your mind.

- review the three biggest goals you have.  Think about how great each one's going to feel and step into that. Visualization essentially

- review your daily tasks and visualize yourself going through each one productively and successfully

- hydrate

- something physical even push ups

- listen to five or ten minutes of some music that pumps you up so you get ready to tackle your day with high energy. it helps to shift you into a more focused and sense of urgency mindset


## PM routine (M - F)

- organize workspace

- run dishes

- take 5 minutes to do a quick clean-up.

- organize any communications, emails etc

- write out all the little things you did right today. Take a few seconds to celebrate each one.  Even something little as not having that extra cookie, focusing more on the project at hand etc

-  answer this "" is there anything I did today knowing what I know now I wouldn't do again in the future? If so why? "" What will I change so that this doesn't recur?""

- answer this ""Did I come across anything today that I should learn further so that it will benefit my life?

- answer "" was there anything today that caused me some type of pain? If so why? How can I avoid it in the future""

-  plan out your next day on paper

- End your day relaxing and doing something you enjoy that's not related to work


##Sat Routine


- review end of day questions for the week

- review your goals for the week and your progress on each one. look where they went well and where they did not and make adjustments after assessing what was the cause of the success or the failure for the week.

-  do your laundry house cleaning and any other organization items,

- review your finances and spending habits for the week.

- review all your lists of good actions you took during the week towards your goals. celebrate those and know that those are all steps that are moving you towards where you're trying to get to.


I'd recommend making a sheet for 

1. Your goals each week.

2. Routine each weekday 

3. Saturday  sheet. 

 I would print them out each week and then keep them somewhere in a binder. Filling them out by hand tends to have a more powerful effect in my opinion than if you just store the files digitally.


you may also want to look into the X effect which is a way to assist with this by printing a chart out on your wall and everyday you X off each item you complete correctly.

I have three of them. One for my morning routine one for  my evening routine and one for my intermittent fasting. 

Really helps.

When you jump into something full-on with no preparation, no planning, it usually leads to burnout, whether its work, exercise, or whatever.

Take small steps, implement habits according to time, don't push everything at once.

Imagine each day as a single life, become curious, learn new things, productivity doesn't have to be tedious and boring. Act as if you are the first person in the world, experiment with everything, increase you perception of reality, it will help you grasp the meaning of your existence, and create your version of reality because life is a subjective experience. Also don't feel guilty about anything, it only leads self-hatred and possibly depression.

But if I stick to my routines (work, exercise, house chores, etc.) EVERY DAY... I'm good. 

Key is finding what balance/routines work for you and just sticking to it, I think, even if the people around you say you should relax more/do more/etc. Especially right now as long as you're still doing something to take care of yourself, your home, and keeping your head above water, you do you.",justpeachblossoms,2,2020-04-22 14:08:14

there was a similar transition on amazon. a lot of products were made by name brands. then fully random chinese-named brands took over. and there are often no clear long-term best options in any category (im
mostly buying construction tools, electronics accessories, scientific equipment).

(not to say chinese manufactured goods arent fine. they can be best in class. it's the chaos and constant change that's problematic. amazon could curate the best laser level and have the price decrease over time on a solid design. instead it lets twenty no-name brands compete against one or two name-brands in the low-cost class and nothing is accomplished over 5 years. likewise the best answer to a question on google is often known, and was established years ago -- but gets buried with time rather than curated.)",ajtrns,64,2022-04-19 15:15:55

Tucker ran a piece where Trudeau was saying even after vaccinations, we will still have to wear masks and socially distance and I thought that was weird, so I searched it on youtube later that day to show my wife.  I was more concerned about the speech that his piece contained rather than Tucker himself. When I searched it on youtube, none of the results weren't even from Tucker.  They were all like, Seth Meyers responds to Tucker Carlson, or something along those lines.   So I hope I don't have to preface everything with how much I think this guy is a dork, but he has the #1 news show in America so his stuff should be easy to find if the algorithms are acting impartial.

*  10 points for each claim that the theory of relativity is fundamentally misguided. 

*  **10 points for claiming that your work is on the cutting edge of a quote, ""paradigm shift.""**

It's deeply tied to history and belief systems. Greeks and Romans practiced euthanasia. It was debated by Christian theologians during the Middle Ages and by the Enlightenment philosophers we still look to today.

For this discussion, I assume, OP, you're willing to take animal euthanasia as a given, that you wouldn't advocate for its abolition. I think it's not helpful to compare animal euthanasia to human, as there's no significant historical debate over whether the former is ethical.

The debate around human euthanasia (and suicide) is interesting in that it shows what a given culture takes for granted as its key value. In Japanese history for instance there was a certain comfort with people committing suicide after ""dishonoring"" themselves, whether in battle or in finance. In Christian cultures, there's a pretty strong correlation between belief that God is ""in control"" and lack of tolerance for euthanasia. And in western medical culture, death is an enemy to be vanquished and virtually no part of a doctor's training is how to approach death in any other way, to the point that many doctors are never even taught how to discuss death with a dying patient's family.

So, OP, as you think about this, I would suggest you rephrase the question as less argumentative (your question implies you've already formed a firm opinion) and more as ""How did it come to be that people believe it is preferable keep a suffering person alive, even against their express wish to die?""",dcgrey,47,2020-07-02 20:32:52

But I think your question might have been something else, or at least there's an equally good question to ask: Why do we *generally* consider it ""merciful"" to euthanize an animal in pain while we *generally* try to keep people alive despite the pain. Think about it not in terms of crippling end-of-life pain but, say, a broken femur that's never going to work right again, or a cancer that's in its early stages. A lot of animals would be put down in those situations, but no one would think about euthanizing a person with those symptoms just yet.

I think the answer there is that humans, because of their developed brains, can have meaningful lives despite disability and pain. We don't have to walk to have friendships. We can enjoy novels, and films, and games even when we hurt and cannot move. We can create and interact and sometimes enjoy life despite pain.

Animals are much more physically-oriented. When they're in pain or disabled (to a degree) it overwhelms their existence and they don't have the intellect to find escape in other things.

Still, one of the tragedies of being a pet owner is that you're never really 100% sure whether the animal has reached that point; whether the cat would rather power through the next three months just to have some more time with you on the couch, or whether she's ready to go.",HowLittleIKnow,6,2020-07-02 20:59:31

2. an instinctive desire to ""see both sides"" of an issue, even when it isn't appropriate to do so;

3. the media's need to maintain a horse-race narrative, as well as individual journalists succumbing to point 2; and

4. the intellectually lazy culture of hating all politicians (""they're all just as bad as each other""), which is used to shield people from having to challenge their own beliefs.

FPTP guarantees a two-party system. It's seen in every single place it's instituted that it eventually devolves into an entrenched, fairly diametrically opposed two-party system. When you have an entrenched two-party system you get something called the spoiler effect. There's a lot of other problems with this voting method. It drives down voter turnout, it radicalizes both sides. You can actually see it polarizing 50% of the population against the other 50% anywhere it's implemented.

However, this also leads to people making weird judgement calls, like what happened this time in the Democratic election. Choosing the person who is ""electable over people who may be better humans and leaders. Or looking toward who they will be up against and who is better primed to beat that person, instead of just choosing someone on their own merit. This leads to some compromises in who is the ""best"" candidate. 

AND, these organizations that run the primaries are not without their own agendas. The DNC and RNC are private organizations, with leaders who want to remain in power; with leaders who have their own back-door deals, friendships, investments, and personal agendas.

The right and left have convinced the average fuckwit (most people in the US) that the other party is evil and your freedoms will suffer under them. They're able to convince people of this because the average fuckwit has been voting for larger and more powerful government on both sides of the aisle. So much so that it makes it plausible that the other party will drastically hurt your freedoms.

The average fuckwit then engages in a cycle of desperately trying to preserve their freedoms by voting for whatever digestive byproduct floats to the surface, or says the prettiest words.

The election choices are shit because the average fuckwit is too terrified to remove their blinders and see the other candidates. The right shut out Rand and Ron Paul. Everyone shuts out Libertarians. The left shuts out solid candidates.

On top of it all, you have the typical power plays and backroom deals so that the political elite can stay in power. So they tug on the average fuckwit's fears and build campaigns of misinformation and half-truths.

And then there's some heavyweight rich people throwing money around to tie themselves to whichever candidate they can that'll win and be able to help them.

Clinton Vs Trump was a complete joke and absolute shit show. Now we got Biden Vs Trump and yet again Im left sitting here thinking to myself...this is what our country came up with?another damn shit show.  We got Biden, a man borderline forgetting why he's even speaking but seems to have no problem smelling and creeping up on his underage relatives. A damn near full blown alzheimers patient. Oh and in the other corner you have Trump  a one percenter, land developer, reality TV show host who has been known to for a fact grope women and pay for sex. Known friend of Mr. Epstein whos the most famous sex trafficking pedophile in American history. I promise that no matter who you vote for it will do no good at all. Yeah,  yeah, we should exercise our freedom and vote, make a change....yeah, make a change alright.  If Mrs. Clinton is Bidens  vice prez I think within his 1st year she'll have had him assassinated and she'll be sworn in immediately.  Them slowly over the next year or so after Mrs Clinton has put a few laws and policies into the works members of congress, white house employees, secret service men and random citizens who oppose her will start to mysteriously start dying from conditions they never had, car accidents, and ""invisible "" snipers. Then the only man willing to put up with her madness, old Bill Clinton will step forth into her chamber deep within a white house bunker. There they will fight to the death. Meanwhile our new all powerful alien overlords will solve 99% of our problems in a day. As Bill Clinton raises  from the bunker ashrs with Hillary's skull mounted on his shoulder his eyes meet the new world paradise created by our new all powerful overlords. A beautiful race of creatures who only want to help and teach us how to live in perfect harmony with science and nature with unlimited free energy and the option to live for hundreds of years happily without sadness. But we decide we should decide exactly what we do with the knowledge they have taught us. The new countries of the world think they should control all others.

It comes down to perception, in part. By being a candidate in a general election, you're pretty much guaranteed that the tiniest of your faults and the unluckiest of your past statements will be blown out of proportion by your opponents.

And if the Republicans can't find enough real shit, they just make up enough in the hopes that some of it will stick.

NoStupidQuestions,Are men really that much stronger than women?,r0rfrg,hlubfu2,"A study done on the grip strength of 1,654 healthy men and 533 healthy women aged 20-25 years found that even professional women athletes in sports like Judo and Handball were significantly less capable than their unprofessional male counterparts. Although grip strength isn't telling of overall strength, it is still quite telling.

&#x200B;

>90% of females produced less force than 95% of males. Though female athletes were significantly stronger (444 N) than their untrained female counterparts, this value corresponded to only the 25th percentile of the male subjects.

\- [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186303/)

To put that in perspective, if there were a room filled with 100 men and 100 women, 90 women could at best contend with the 5 weakest men. The remaining 10 women outliers, as advanced in athletics as they may be, could only grip as hard as the bottom 25 guys.",Crazed_waffle_party,4630,2021-11-24 01:00:10

She had a temper and tended to be a little bit rough on training. From what I know she had some issues growing up and they would come out from time to time.

She got into an altercation with someone else and I made the mistake of trying to separate her from the person. She hit me 2 times and tried to take me to the ground. I lifted her up and took her to the other side of the gym. She calmed down and stopped talking to me for years.

She told me years later that she was afraid of me because I barely even moved when she hit me. It saddened me a little.

(Yes, that’s the right number of zeros.) The same is true of Olympic, World, and U.S.  Champion Allyson Felix’s 400 meters lifetime best of 49.26.  Just in the single year 2017, men and boys around the world outperformed her more than 15,000 times.""

Yup, you read that right ""boys"" males under the age of 18. The best mature women in the world with a decade more training can't even touch an elite male high schooler's numbers.

NoStupidQuestions,Is Russia truly doing such a poor job in the invasion of Ukraine or are we just being fed propaganda?,u2r0y1,i4krlcn,"There's an element of the fact that the west is generally on Ukraine's side, and that we're therefore seeing a Ukraine-centric perspective

But at the same time, the maps don't lie: Russia was expected to roll Ukraine over in a matter of days or weeks, yet is now 7 weeks into the war and have clearly not steamrolled Ukraine or even achieved their likely/apparent goals

There's no way around the fact that Russia clearly (despite their new ""You didn't dump me, I dumped you, I didn't even want to date you in the first place"" narrative) wanted to take Kyiv and enforce regime change. And not only did they not achieve that in the first few days as they clearly expected, and not only have they not achieved it at all... but they've even retreated away from the area and given up on the objective entirely. There's no way to realistically paint that as anything other than an abjact failure

Even if this had been a near-peer conflict (a war between two sides expected to be of roughly equal strength) then the attacker would expected to achieve some major objectives, otherwise why are they attacking at all? But Russia was one of the most feared militaries on the planet and Ukraine barely even a blip on the regional map, and Ukraine fought them to a standstill well short of Russia's objectives.

That's not to say Russia can't get anything out of this war or will have entirely failed - but thus far they've tanked their economy and killed 5-10k of their own men, shattered their military reputation on the world stage, united NATO and the EU, started Germany on a re-militarization path, pushed Finland and Sweden into NATO's hands, and is still nowhere near to even achieving their ""fallback"" goals of taking the entirety of Donbas.

It's possible that Russia could have a successful offensive in the east and take the rest of Donbas and secure Mariupol (which looks inevitable), on top of the canal supplying Crimea's water which has already been captured. You could consider that Russia has, at that point, achieved enough objectives to be worth the invasion - but the cost for that has been huge and it's hard to argue that it's been worthwhile

The only thing Russia has *really* achieved is to secure the Crimean water supply, and to ensure Ukraine doesn't join NATO... but that was already off the table since 2014, all Russia had to do was continue quietly supporting the existing war in Donbas and Ukraine was going to stay out of NATO anyway",audigex,14070,2022-04-13 15:30:28

NoStupidQuestions,Is Russia truly doing such a poor job in the invasion of Ukraine or are we just being fed propaganda?,u2r0y1,i4kkfij,"Good question.  Here's my understanding so far:

Russia has a logistics issue.  They have a lot of tanks and mechanized vehicles but they can't get the supplies to them.  Reason is they rely heavily on their rail network which the closest one, in the beginning of the war, was in Belarus at the border of Ukraine.  A few weeks ago, the Ukrainians and some Belarus defectors blew up the rail line at the Russian border which caused the Russian supply lines to fall back even further.

Russia was prepared for a 7ish day war.  Steam roll in there, knock out the capital and retake the country.  That didn't happen due to fierce resistance and now they're facing that supply chain issue which continually gets worse the longer this goes on.

The whole thing is very interesting in that Russia believes NATO to be an aggressor and an enemy.  Russia wants a buffer zone between themselves and NATO.  Geographically, the border of Ukraine and Russia is sparse farmland with no natural barriers.  If Russia were to push it's borders further west, then they have geographic barriers like mountains.  Strategically, this makes sense to give them a buffer against, what they perceive, is a NATO invasion.

Crimea was taken in 2014.  Crimea has a lot of oil reserves off the coast.  This was also a foothold into Ukraine.  The one thing that Crimea doesn't have is a lot of fresh water.  They have one river that runs thru Ukraine and thru the area which Ukraine dammed off in their territory.  This caused Russia to have to import water for 2.1M people during a time where record breaking heatwaves were occurring.  Logistically, this was a nightmare for Russia as they had to build infrastructure (Bridges) and use trucks to get fresh water into Crimea and continue their oil exploitation.

There are vast oil reserves off the coast of Ukraine and Crimea.  If Russia can just capture the coastal areas and unblock the dam then they can land-lock Ukraine and cause economic and supply chain issues into Ukraine.  This would force the Ukraine to the bargaining table and possibly force them under the Russian umbrella.

If you look closely at the [battle map](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682) and whats going on, you can see where Russia has pushed themselves along the coast lines to make the above possible.  I don't know specifically where the Dam in the Ukraine is located, but at one point during the beginning Russia had done a spearhead attack directly up that river.

So, it's a ""Win"" for Russia if they can unblock that dam and if they can capture the coast.  It's a bigger ""Win"" for Russia if they take the entire country.  The longer this drags on though, the worse it's going to get.

The West has evolved in Warfare (Debatable, but hear me out).  We don't carpet bomb cities anymore.  We don't indiscriminately gas civilian population centers.  Russia doesn't care about this and will carpet bomb as they see fit.  The longer this goes on the more of a chance to see Gas attacks on civilians and who knows what's next after that.

Back on point, to answer your question:  Yes, propaganda on both sides.  However, the battle map is really what to keep an eye on with those points above in mind.  The atrocities are horrible and I hope this will end soon.  If Putin can get those above goals, he will most likely call it quits even if he doesn't take the country itself.",IxI_DUCK_IxI,1359,2022-04-13 14:43:38

You are being fed propaganda.

Russia has no intention of occupying the entire country. They made a quick advance to encircle the remaining Ukrainian army (which is mainly composed of the paramilitary forces incorporated into the National Guard (ie Azov, and other battalions), foreign fighters (redditers, ISIS, and others), and ad hoc militants (using weapons donated by the US and EU), and have worked methodically and slowly to drive out the fighting forces, while marking non-combattants and sympathizers with white armbands. Once they are done, they leave the city they have occupied, and the Western media calls this a great defeat, that they've been 'driven out'. This is the propaganda we are getting fed.

Russia has worked to open escape corridors to allow many of these forces to leave, as they know people not committed to a losing cause will drop their uniforms and escape with other civilians. This is why the remaining Ukrainian fighters (who, again, are not nearly 100% Ukrainian, and have very little interest in limiting civilian casualties), have been attacking those corridors, banning men under 60 from leaving the country, limiting civilian escapes in order to use them as meat shields and steal their supplies, while spreading propaganda about all this to Western media.

Ukraine is losing, many Ukrainian officials presenting themselves to peace talks have been assassinated, and their president is working under threat of death for the fascists in the government and army. Russia has never intended to decapitate the government, they have been constantly asking for negotiations since before the invasion, since before Minsk and Minsk II were signed. Zelensky should be calling for medical and supplies aid, but is only asking for more weapons to fight a losing war.

The Ukrainian side has made daring attacks into Russia itself, including an attack at a fuel depot,  but ultimately from what I read moral and supplies are very low.  There is a serious chance that the vast majority of the Ukr army will be trapped in the Donbass region if Russian pincers from the North and South are successful. 

I have questions about the Ukr army training and effectiveness after the video emerged of about a dozen Ukr soldiers being wiped out after a Russian tank literally rolled right up to them and none of them recognized it. Then again, why didn't the Russian tank fire sooner instead of driving within 40 meters of the soldiers?

Which could still be staged or faked, but that's a big risky operation and it leaves fingerprints. If a video has been accepted true in the public sphere for a while, I tend to believe it's true. 

So, what have I seen on video? Well, I've seen Russian tanks stranded and out of fuel, the crew telling a random passer-by they have no idea what's going on. I've seen Russian armor columns routed by vastly inferior forces. I've seen Ukrainian farm tractors towing Russian armor away. I've seen drone footage of trenches dug in Chernobyl's Red Forest surrounded by abandoned gear. 

While none of that can give me a full picture of how the war is going overall, it does suggest a deep problem of poor organization in the Russian army. 

Many of those things would *never* happen with the US army, and they still basically lost their most recent war. The idea of an M1-A1 out of gas on the side of the road, or getting towed away by an Afghani farmer? We've never even seen that, and the US army was there for two decades.

- Russia outnumbers Ukraine in terms of military equipment by far.
- Russia has nukes
- Russia is a covert dictatorship. We know this because Mr Putin changed the constitution so he can serve more than two terms 

And yet, dispute all of these known facts, they have been unable to conquer Ukraine by now. How is that even possible given the massively superior armed forces? 

And this is just stats... Then if you look at history you can see that Russia has no problem with commuting crimes against humanity. Is it that hard to believe they're doing it again? China is doing it all day long but we're choosing to ignore that since they are not bothering any western country yet. So is north Korea for that matter but do we care? Nope.

So what does this mean?    It means you can get a scanner (sometimes an app on your phone will do!)

Just the fact that you are trying to make a transaction with something that isn't a card—or a phone, in the case of people that have the tap function—it is going to throw up some red flags for any employee that gives more than a single shit about their job. Even if you would technically be legally allowed to do so, it is your card after all, chances are you're going to run into a lot of issues where people are going to flag the card use when you don't have a physical card, and they're going to want to see proof that the transaction you were making was with a card in your name. If you don't have the card to be able to present the number along with the security code on the back—also with your signature on it by the way, that part is a lot more important than people think, I also worked for a while in customer service for a credit card company and I can't tell you how many calls I had to take where a customer was being declined a charge because the retailer asked to verify the signature but they didn't have anything to compare it to—they might decline the transaction. Worst case scenario, they might even call someone suspecting you of credit card fraud. A lot of retail employees could give a shit less, they don't get paid enough to deal with that sort of thing, etc, but I have known some cashiers in the multiple places that I have worked retail that would have absolutely jumped on the possibility of ruining someone's day because they just get so pissed off at customers in general that they will take any petty vengeance they can.",IshiDoesntKnowThings,6,2022-11-05 00:35:57

Just by virtue of the word ""weighted blanket"" being in the search I got pages and pages of nothing but ads trying to sell them, and zero meaningful discourse on why I would use one. So then I have to resort to limiting myself by searching ""site:www.reddit.com weighted blanket benefits"" just so I can get connected to real people talking about the device and its benefits/drawbacks. 

Anyway, fuck Google. It's still okay for searching about concepts, but if you try to search anything even remotely commercial or that can be sold as a product then good fucking luck.

Even Wikipedia is often on the second page instead of the first result now?,goiaa5,frhe1tz,"Like others have said, it's not just in your head and it is unfortunately 100% intentional. It's true that Google spams ads in Search and any site that uses Google Ad Services with hidden trackers (about 76% of the internet as reported by CNBC), but the more sinister thing to consider is WHY do they do this? I put a TL;DR but it's very worth it to check out all the links I tagged in this.

TL;DR - It's not about money. Everything Google presents you is a social experiment to see how you will interact with what they put in front of you. Google intentionally inconveniences you as part of the experiment. All of that data is collected, attributed to the personal profile they have of you and used educate their machine learning and artificial intelligences, just like in the movie Ex Machina. Google will probably be first to create sentient AI. Here's their progress from 2 years ago so they of course are farther along now. [Google's AI Assistant Can Now Make Real Phone Calls](https://youtu.be/JvbHu_bVa_g) 

The Daily Mail and Forbes report Alphabet (Google's parent company founded by Google executives) is valued at over 1 trillion dollars. Google is by no means struggling financially and does not NEED to spam the whole internet with ads so then why do they do it? There are many reasons and none of them as simple as greed. I have a friend who used to work at Google X (Google's own Area 51 branch) and he's confirmed to me many times how Google is the most brilliant, nefarious company on earth. 

It's not about money. Everything Google presents you is a social experiment to see how you will interact with what they put in front of you. Google (and Facebook and Amazon) track how you INTERACT with a page's information ([Google and Facebook are watching our everyone move online.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/google-facebook-data-privacy-concerns-out-of-control-commentary.html) ). 
This means how long you hover over an item with the mouse, how long you keep your screen positioned on certain objects, what you do and don't click on, how long you stay on a certain link or page, how have you interacted with similar links/objects in the past and much more. They have a system in place that measures where they think your eyes are focused when looking at the screen. Google intentionally inconveniences you as part of the experiment in order to see how you will react (Facebook got in trouble for the same things years ago but everybody does it now [Facebook's secret psychological experiment on users.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/facebook-sorry-secret-psychological-experiment-users) ). All of this data is collected, attributed to the hugely intricate personal profile they have of you and used educate their machine learning and artificial intelligences, just like in the movie Ex Machina. In that movie, the genius founder of a tech company similar to Google funnels all the information from the world's search history into an AI to potentially create sentience. Google's legitimately doing the same thing. I am not a conspiracy theorist and I mean this in the most literal, non-sensationalist way but Google genuinely wants world domination thorough tech. Not money, not simply power or influence, but the ability to manipulate the minds and lives of the masses however they please. It's the closest power trip to being a god. The more you read insightful tech news with insider knowledge, the more you come to see this is true.

EDIT: Forgot to say, if you really care about your privacy, which we all should, then you should use Firefox as your default browser with AdBlockPlus and DuckDuckGo.com as your search engine. These are the only major players who don't track you and sell your data. Also check your privacy settings on all social media because you have more options than you realize, and finally, you can turn off the extreme default personalization of Google Ad Services if you want. You'll start getting lots of weird random ads but they won't be based on invasive info collected on you.

It used to be that you could include keywords that would be weighed based on how specific they are - makes sense to determine if you're googling for a broad topic, or looking for very specific information.

However these days the algorithm prioritizes the popularity of a result over the quality of the match with your search terms. 

For instance, you may be searching for ""Win 10 VPN split horizon routing"", and it will give you results related only to ""Win 10"" or ""Win 10 VPN"" that have nothing to do with the actual query, because the result's ranking is higher than that of the actually relevant match.",darps,18,2020-05-22 15:24:17

Even Wikipedia is often on the second page instead of the first result now?,goiaa5,frglvn2,"IMO as a developer, the issue is that Google has tried to rely more on things like prediction and less on what you're actually typing in. 

I find it getting harder to find what I'm looking for because when I type something in, EXACTLY how I want it, the search results are polluted with ""similar"" shit that doesn't match my query. 

Even when I use Quotes, it still doesn't perform an exact search half the time.

They've done this shit throughout a lot of their products. Even the history search doesn't return things ver batim. The URL bar also searches history and doesn't return half the sites I've visited, only the things it *thinks* I want. This means that unlike in the past, if I know I visited a site, half the time the only way to get the URL is to manually scroll through my history.

I'm assuming this is to cater to people who have no idea how to use a search engine, browser, etc, but for those of us that got used to crafting explicit queries, it's really fucked us over.

It's the same shit MS has done with Windows. The windows search became shit because it started trying to guess what you want instead of just returning what you type in.

The biggest problem is when you're trying to look for something slightly more specific. The search engine favors popular search results over what you actually want. Something google used to be really good at.... 

I can't think of any specific example for this but basically it ends up with you getting the exact opposite result of what you want just because ""why bananas are healthy"" is more popular then ""why bananas are unhealthy"", even if you search for the latter you get results for the former, for no reason. And if you search for something like ""big bananas linked to blah blah blah because blah blah blah"" instead of getting specific query you will still get ""why bananas are healthy"" and nowhere will you get a single article even trying to answer the thing you're looking for.

Popularity of the article and of the website itself seems to be weighted far more important than answering the actual querry.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do billionaires and other very rich individuals try so hard to avoid paying taxes when they will still be rich whether they pay the taxes or not?,qg8yc2,hi53zai,"This is a complicated question. Let me first start by sayin that most of the ultra wealthy have wealth through assets, either physical property or stock ownership NOT through income. When we say Musk is worth 200B, most of that is assets. His liquid wealth, while still substantial, is likely much much smaller, maybe a few hundred million. You also must understand that money is not the same to the wealthy as it is to us. Money for them is a tool used to create more wealth. Anything which diminishes that tool must be minimized in order to maximize the usefulness of the tool. Basically we have a few motivating factors here, one is the desire to sustain a lavish lifestyle utilizing a much smaller amount of liquid assets, so paying 25% of 300 million will actually lower their ability to own all those fancy houses and yachts and rub elbows with politicians and officials. Second, is the desire to utilize wealth to productively to make more wealth. While a few million less may not be substantial, those few million may be worth 10x or 100x if properly invested, so the pain of that tax is many times multiples. Third the desire to avoid taxes on assets which is a whole separate discussion around property rights, but when 98% percent of your worth is in assets, you sure don’t want that to happen.",ZombieJesusaves,18339,2021-10-26 17:51:48

Let's say you make $50k a year and live comfortably.  If the government came to you and say they were going to take an additional $5k in taxes, would you object?  After all, you're not ""starving"".

I've built my wealth from literally nothing, and I'll be damned if I'm going to just give it away to the government to watch them piss it away on stupid shit, run up our national debt, then turn around and have the fucking NERVE to demand more money from me.

Can you imagine the ripple effect that would occur if a CEO or founder of the company sold off billions $ of shares in their own company. Imagine if Bezos just sold billions of his own stock off.

These sorts of rules (in theory) create jobs, value, and innovation while a business owner or investor will choose to abide by them in exchange to get their kid's tuition, their mom's hospital bills, or if all is going well, a new car.

So it becomes about the reward. 50 years ago that deal was working a full time job and getting to own a house, support a family, and put money into your true passions. 

Now you need to go into massive debt to get the kind of education the job market demands. Regular jobs don't cut it for independant survival any more, never mind saving any money. Cost of living is so high that dual-income parents can't support their kids. Property is nearly inaccessible to anyone born in the last thirty years. 

And in response to this we're constantly told to just try harder. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps, get a side hustle. It's a degrading system, the alternative to which is homelessness.

NoStupidQuestions,How do you get out of bed every morning just to go to a job?,lcgow6,gm003b9,"I love this post. I’m depressed and have been for years and have wondered the same thing. If you don’t make a certain income and/or are living paycheck-to-paycheck and you’re not passionate about your work, I really don’t understand how people do that for years on end. I’m only 25 and I was fed up with working years ago to the point that I even became suicidal. Maybe I have a sense of entitlement having grown up with many things given to me admittedly, but even if that hadn’t been the case I’m pretty sure I would still feel similar, maybe further down the road. I don’t know how people go for 40 years spending 1/3 of their lives doing something they hate. Many people respond to that with reasons such as having kids or family members to take care of, and while I respect that, it still sounds depressing to have to sign away a third of your life just to make ends meet for yourself and a few other people.

Not to change the subject but I really feel as though the current wealth gap at least in the U.S. is a main contributor to why so many people have to live this way. It’s unfortunate. I’m not hating on people that have become successful, but more than 50% of all wealth is in the hands of 1% of the people. This is what creates the unhealthy work-life balance that many people experience while people like Jeff Bezos and Oprah have multiple homes which are unoccupied for most of the year. Spaces which could very well be inhabited by people that would be more than happy to live there full-time.

Ultimately time is money. Everybody knows that. So following that logic, if there is someone such as Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates that could never work another day in their life and still be more than comfortable, that means that proportionately, logically, and inevitably, there are going to be numerous people that will never get to experience what it’s like to have more than 8 hours of down time per day (really 5-6 or even less if you count commuting and taking care of other responsibilities).",inner_smile,321,2021-02-04 15:58:26

The resto of the time was spent with their families and friends: their tribe, the people that they loved. Sure, they had plenty of other stressors, including a shorter lifespan, high infant mortality, deadly disease and animals, etc., but they were external stressors that the mind had millions of years to evolve to deal with. HGs weren't worried about money or politics.

Our HG brains are not equipped to deal with 50 hour work plus all the other shit in life. u/poop_wagon, you are not alone, and feeling like this is completely normal.

I don't do my job because I like it. I do my job because it makes me money and that gives me the ability to do things that I do like.

I got out of bed this morning because I wanted to take a walk and think about things, life, the world, things I wanted to see and visit. Work is just something, one of the things, that I do. It's not who I am, or all that I do. I enjoy going out and helping people, so when I walk to work, that's an opportunity for me to find chances I can help people.

I'm an ICU nurse and I work with a group of people that make the job bearable. We get along well and have a unique, morbid sense of humor.

Of course having to work isn't fun. It isn't meant to be. Even if you like your job you'd still prefer not doing it. But it's like a chore. It's not necessarily pleasant to do it but it's necessary to get the best part of life : the not-work.

I think it's waaay better to have a boring time for 8 hours a day then live the rest of your day being happy thanks to the money you make rather than just dying and avoiding both the bad and the good things of life.

So to sum up : I don't get fulfillment out of a job well done either but I know that thanks to this job I can afford having good moments outside of work. And these moments make the work worth it.",ClafoutisRouge,17,2021-02-04 16:56:40

Once you figure out that answer, its going to guide you further into what a more enjoyable and fulfilling career, hobby, or pastime will be. If you really would prefer to just watch TV, what programs do you watch? Why do you like them? What about them are interesting?   
Do you only watch drama? Fantasy? Do you like fantasy stories? Have you tried writing before? Etc. Etc.

NoStupidQuestions,How do you get out of bed every morning just to go to a job?,lcgow6,gm08rmk,"Not really an answer to your question, but Karl Marx addressed this feeling with much nuance, calling it the [alienation of the worker from their labor](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm):

> All these consequences are implied in the statement that the worker is related to the product of labor as to an alien object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful becomes the alien world of objects which he creates over and against himself, the poorer he himself – his inner world – becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. **The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the more the worker lacks objects. Whatever the product of his labor is, he is not. Therefore, the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.**

NoStupidQuestions,How do you get out of bed every morning just to go to a job?,lcgow6,gm19stq,"I feel you on this one. Are you a creative type per chance?

Creatives tend to be “free spirits” and feel confined and stunted in any work they do regardless of if they like or are good at it.

Do you particularly have ADHD as well? That’s also a typical feeling ADHD people have (speaking as a person with ADHD who’s also studied psychology).

Have you considered/looked into becoming self employed in some way? If it’s not financially feasible to be self employed, a temporary solution is to work a job that pays the bills but also allows you enough time to work towards being self employed. “A job to pay for your hobby” if you will. A small example is how my mother in law works a technical job but couldn’t care less about computers to supplement her ceramics shop and her horses that she loves. She works 12 hour days but only for 3 days and has 4 days to herself to do what she enjoys. She only has a high school diploma as far as I know so degrees aren’t even necessarily that integral (not useless, I have a degree and proud of it, but it’s not always necessary).

I hope you can find your passion. If you’re under 30, this is quite normal to feel. We go through a few life crises throughout our lives and I learned in one of my psychology classes that the average adult will change careers at least 7 times in their entire lifespan. 

It’s annoying and frustrating but don’t give up! Just keep trying to find yourself and worst case scenario, there’s always retirement to look forward to.

NoStupidQuestions,"How true is this, ""Most people would rather work with someone who's mediocre at their job, but pleasant to be around, than a person who's exceptionally good, but a dick""?",mg10fe,gsqxn0y,"I worked in IT for over 25 years and I've worked with people who were phenomenal at their job but complete dicks.  They were eventually fired and everyone was relieved.  Also if they asked people for help they were less likely to get it.  If they messed up (happens to everyone) then they were given less sympathy or leeway. One guy was such a dick that everyone was warned when they started in IT to stay away from him.  Day 1 I had to ask him something for my boss.  He ripped into me about how stupid I was by not knowing how their network was setup, after being there a whole 2 hours. I didn't wrk in the network department.  It boggles my mind that he lasted another 2 years before they got rid of him.

I've worked with people who were mediocre to good and were great people, they received more help, more leeway and more kudos than the phenomenal but dicks people.

I've worked with people who were not phenomenal (ranging from bad to good) who were dicks.  They didn't last long at all. Now that I think about it most of them left IT.

If you go out of your way to be helpful and polite and reasonably easy to get along with you'll do alright as long as you have basic skills and do your best to learn and not make the same mistakes over and over.  When you're starting out you can earn really good brownie points (very valuable in the workplace) by volunteering for the sucky jobs.  Every now and then we had a situation where we required a couple of people to come in on a weekend and do something extremely tedious.  Those that volunteered and did it really went up in everyone's estimation.  After that they tended to get the mentoring and better projects.

If you're getting into IT one thing that I don't think people talk enough about is networking (the people type, not the computer type). Nobody knows everything, but if you know someone who would know the answer or be able to direct you towards the answer that is extremely valuable.  I personally suck at PCs and network stuff but if I need to do something with either of those things I have about 5 or 6 people I can call and get help, even though I no longer work with them.  Just don't abuse the connection and be contacting them for favours too much.

Good luck.",terrip_t1,7,2021-03-30 00:16:32

For every genre there are a ton of people who love them.

EDIT: I keep getting the same response, so I’m just going to answer it here. “Sports aren’t predetermined, you don’t know who’ll win”

My mum loves cricket. So let’s look at that. Team A will send in a bowler. He’ll throw the ball. Because of the rules of the sport, as well as the limitations of physics and human physiology, he’ll throw it in one of half a dozen ways. The batsman will try to hit the ball. Once again, there are a limited number of ways to do that. Then he’ll run between the stumps while the fielders try to catch the ball and get him out. Once they’ve done that six times, they’ll send in a different bowler. Once they’ve done that 50 times, or gotten 10 batters out, Team B will bowl. 

And every single ball will look like that. 

“But that’s a massive oversimplification!” Yes it is. And so is “the hero will always win”

I’m not a fan of cricket, and all I see is the same cycle of throw the ball, hit the ball, run done again and again and again. Every single ball is almost identical to the one before and the one after. And I wonder how can anyone enjoy this? But a cricket fan will see how each bowler bowls a little differently. Each batsman responds differently. Each fielder reacts differently. You’ll see a world of fun and variation where I see only the repetition. 

I look at superhero movies and see that The Batman focused on the detective side, while Love and Thunder went cosmic, No Way Home lent heavily into nostalgia, and Multiverse of Madness embraced the weird! These were all very different movies to me, and the fact that they were all released close together doesn’t effect how much a fan enjoys them. But someone like OP who obviously isn’t a fan just sees the same powered individual fights a villain and saves the world formula repeated again and again. 

This is true of *all* entertainment. Cop shows, Rom-Coms, music, books, sports, superheroes. Everything has its repetitive elements that make it seem boring to those who aren’t fans.

NoStupidQuestions,How are people not sick and tired of superhero movies yet?,vymj5z,ig3fhlo,"My glib answer is: your question is like asking why aren't audiences sick of action, science fiction, or romance movies yet.

My second glib answer is: your question is based on the current supply of *Marvel* superhero movies. The MCU is like 80% of the current superhero movie market right now; their next competitor, DC film universe, is far behind in success, clout, and how much attention people pay to them.

My more realistic answer is: people aren't sick of them because they're still fun and interesting. Obviously, everyone has a different threshold of just how much they consider superhero movies fun and interesting. I personally know friends who never jumped on the superhero movie train, so their threshold was zero movies. I myself remained highly excited all the way to the latest ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", which is the 29th movie of the MCU. I am still excited to see the new Marvel films.

To help you better find your answer, you should look into why the Western genre (e.g. ""3:10 to Yuma"", Clint Eastwood's ""A Fistful of Dollars"") went away. They were massive during the 70s and 80s but then eventually fell out of favor. Sooner or later, that same thing will happen to superhero films.

NoStupidQuestions,How are people not sick and tired of superhero movies yet?,vymj5z,ig3ui0p,"This is probably an unpopular opinion but I think we're seeing an infantilization of society and culture - as people especially in the west find it harder economically to become adults (buy a house, raise a family, get a stable job) youth culture reaches further up in the ages.

These movies look to me like the kind of movies I enjoyed as a twelve year old basically - classic action comedies like Shanghai Noon and Rush Hour that were mostly popular with kids. Now, 20 years later, the same movies are being marketed (and enjoyed by) not only to kids, but to young adults as well.

I don't think this is an individual thing - it's not that having insecure housing and insecure jobs makes you like superhero movies - instead it's a culture shift. In a society when growing up in the traditional sense becomes harder, youth culture becomes popular even in ages higher than what was common 20 years ago.",rytlejon,23,2022-07-14 09:24:41

NoStupidQuestions,Since wifi is sent through waves in the air if I put a fan behind my router will it make my Wi-Fi reach me faster?,1gygoxp,lyovefs,"Great question. For all intents and purposes, the fan will have no effect on the speed of the WiFi signal. BUT WiFi is basically an EM frequency just like visible light (Light is a shorter wavelength, infrared is a longer wavelength, followed by microwaves and finally radio/wifi). And EM waves, just like light, will travel at different speeds through different media depending on their refractive index; light travels fastest in a vacuum. In transparent media such as air, glass, or water, it will travel slightly more slowly, depending on their density among other factors.

Interestingly enough, wind will have a slightly different density than still air. The difference is negligible but not 0.

Just for fun, let's say your fan was capable of blowing wind at Mach 10, or 10x the speed of sound. Your air will have compressed significantly and its density will have increased by 1000x. This means the speed of light would be about **22% slower** in Mach 10 winds compared to still air.

For a conventional fan though, the difference in WiFi speed would be closer to 0.0000000047%. So not much of a difference. But still a difference!",FadieZ,178,2024-11-24 04:15:16

NoStupidQuestions,Since wifi is sent through waves in the air if I put a fan behind my router will it make my Wi-Fi reach me faster?,1gygoxp,lypfrnm,"Just about everyone else here is wrong.

First of all, [the speed of light changes when you put it through a medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#In_a_medium) \- that is why we refer to c, aka 299,792,458 m/s as the speed of light in vacuum. The speed of light in any medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index of light in that medium. This applies to all electromagnetic waves, whether visible light or the microwaves used by WiFi.

The phenomenon that movement of a medium affects the speed of light has been confirmed since 1851 by the [Fizeau experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizeau_experiment), for more details, see the Wikipedia page on [light-dragging effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-dragging_effects). For specifics on the underlying equations, see this paper on [Fresnel drag](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=111208).

The specific amount of time that such a fan would decrease the signal time will be given by the equation of Δt = L/(c\_n + v(1 - 1/n\^2)), where L is the distance between the signal source and recipient, n is the refractive index of the medium (1.00029 for air), c\_n is the speed of light in the medium which is equal to c/n (299792458/1.00029 = 299705543.4 m/s), and v is the speed at which the medium is moving.

To give a ballpark estimate of the time difference, I'll assume the router is in the same room, let's say 5 meters away. Say the fan can move air at an average speed of 2 m/s over this distance. The resulting time difference will be about 5/(299705543.4 + 2(1 - 1/1.00029\^2)) = 1.66830414e-8 or about 16.68 nanoseconds.

However, since ping is two-way, all this time gain is lost right back to the return signal having to fight against the wind. But for the purpose of a signal in a single direction, the fan indeed helps. For reference, 16.68 nanoseconds is about on par with the CAS latency of a slower kit of modern computer memory, such as the very common DDR5 4800 MT/s CL40. Though of course for the purposes of internet-based tasks, this latency difference is absolutely insignificant.

Edit: I used the equation wrong, the Δt is the total time taking the speed of the medium into account, the time difference caused by the movement of the medium is actually 64.5 zeptoseconds as calculated by DNosnibor",Daniel_H212,15,2024-11-24 07:05:01

This would result in the functional range going down, since both directions of communication are required.

(Also, the limiting factor is actually the strength of the waves, as they spread out with distance kinda like a ripple in water, so a fan wouldn't work, but a device designed to aim the waves could dramatically increase range, and such setups do exist, just not for WiFi as that is meant to communicate with many devices, not one far away).",InterestsVaryGreatly,2,2024-11-24 05:06:38

NoStupidQuestions,Since wifi is sent through waves in the air if I put a fan behind my router will it make my Wi-Fi reach me faster?,1gygoxp,lypjeuz,"Others have already answered the direct question, but let’s see if there’s actually a way to make your WiFi signal reach you earlier.

As others have said, WiFi is electromagnetic waves which travel at the speed of light. This is usually the fastest thing that can travel in a medium, so the only way to be faster is to switch to a medium where light is faster (eg vacuum). Light is faster in vacuum than air roughly 1.0003 times. This means if your router is ~65 ft (20m) away, WiFi will reach you about 0.02 ns earlier.

This difference is really small for us, but can still have a significant impact in some settings. This article from nature [1] goes over how high frequency trading firms use millimetre wave connections to be faster than competitors in the range of milliseconds. Most internet service providers nowadays use fibre optics, which have a far lower speed of light (apparently 0.67 times that of vacuum according to the article). By using air to propagate signals instead, these firms are able to trade earlier than others and react faster to the market.

Of course, all of this is just for latency, which is the time it takes for WiFi to reach you. Bandwidth, or the amount of information to reach you over time, is a whole different game. This is what people usually mean when they want WiFi to be faster. This is not really impeded by the medium, because the information itself is not contained in the wave, but in how it is changes over time. Think of it like this: say you are in a dark room by the light switch. When you turn the light on, somebody really far away can also see the light in your room, and you can signal to this person by turning the light switch on and off. The bandwidth here is the rate at which you turn the switch on and off, while the latency is the time it takes for the other person to notice the light came on/went off from the time you switched it. Really, the only way for WiFi to be faster in the bandwidth sense is for your internet service providers to add more cables to the rest of the internet.

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu1s3nw,"As someone who's gone thru something similar also in Eastern Europe in the 90s here's some practical advice to get you thru:


1) A running joke at that time but also 100% accurate is: ""You just need 2 things to survive, your life and your passport"".


Have your documents ready. Passport is king, but university/high school/education diplomas/immunization records...Anything that vouchers for who you are what you have accomplished will help you get thru borders or refugee camps or visas. If you leave your place and you can carry only one thing it's documentation.


2) Fill up your bathroom tub with water. You can drain it as needed for personal hygiene as long as you have running water but always have it full afterwards if you do not know when you're going to lose it. 


3) go get gasoline. Fill up your car if you have one. And buy canisters and fill them up. Gas is worth more than gold when stations run dry. And they will. People will kill each other over it so hide it and don't tell anyone you have it. You can use it for your own needs, you can sell it later, you can trade it. Cash won't be worth much as inflation is going to render cash worthless. Gas will be the new cash. And if you did put it in your vehicle someone will siphon it out quickly. So hide the car too :)


4) go get candles. Better and cheaper than batteries. Can be somewhat reused as long as you keep the wax.


5) go buy a tub of lard. It's winter so it'll keep for a while if power runs out and shouldn't be expensive now. Get lots of crackers and if you can, paprika powder. Crackers + lard + paprika = tons of calories and tastes ok. You can also take this stuff with you if you need to make a getaway.


6) list is getting long and there are many nice to haves but your life is most important so if you can get one more thing get bags of nuts. Walnuts/peanuts/whatever-you-can get-your-hands-on nuts = calories (and they won't spoil)


Now you have water and calories and light. With gas and paperwork you're better off than most people in the same situation. So be careful who you share that with.

Last note to hopefully put your mind at ease, the invading force will go after militarily targets first. Stay clear and you'll be relatively safe. If you find that you must run...lie, cheat and trust very few (if any) as you make your run. Unless there are genocidal atrocities (rare, but happen) you will make it.

This sucks. I hope it doesn’t happen to you. But you will make it. Good luck to you my friend.",International_Fly_67,10745,2022-01-24 18:17:49

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu2chrp,"As a war survivor (4 years Sarajevo siege) I can tell you that you can't plan that shit because every war is different, but if you have to, then firstly I'd put duct tape or similar tape on your windows in a triple cross pattern directly onto the glass. If the windows shatter due to the blast the tape will keep them more or less in one piece and this will prevent injury to a certain extent. In case of close military conflict in the area you need to close all the gas to your house at the main valve. Find one of those hanging wallets that you put around your neck and keep all your documents there, passport, IDs, etc. 

If you have any valuables try and stash them in a good place (honestly, I'd dig them somewhere outdoors and share the location with someone i trust in case I don't make it) 

Depending on where you live (block or a separate house) and if you are civilian or military, you will need to know the place where to hide in case od shelling, usually underground. Be it ready made facilities or basements/underground parkings etc., and you need to have a kit of items with you at all times: flash light, small radio receiver with good batteries (remember that most probably everything will be cut including TV and the internet, and your only source of information will be radio, high calorie, no expiry food such as nuts, dark chocolate, dried meat, cans etc., candles, a lot of candles, good lighter or even a few of them, batteries, board games, playing cards (sometimes the emergency lasts for days and it can take a lot of time between the attacks), also it would be good to have some kind of small weapon with you even if you are just a civilian. 

One of the things I remember we missed a lot during the war was yeast for bread making. We used to burn books from our private libraries to cook meals, and also burn wooden flooring to cook and heat. 

Not sure what your situation is, but try avoiding alcohol, during those times, even though it will be tempting. 

I dunno what else to say except that wars are horrible and there are no words to describe the horror that is left in souls and hearts of those who survive them.

After that, be sure to give what you can. Time, energy, tins, nappies ... does not matter. The more each person gives the stronger the network becomes and the wider it grows.

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu0vl28,"Buy some white sheets to drape outside your windows. This shows people that there *are* people in the house and they are non-combatants. It may help prevent soldiers (from both sides) targeting your house on purpose, but sadly, nothing will help prevent stray shots.

If you have a basement/root cellar and there's room enough, place some sleeping bags down there, a space heater, some bottled water, and some dried food. If fighting starts near you, get in there and stay in there.

Supplies should include food, blankets, bottled water, warm jackets, warm boots, gloves, warm hats, socks, a backpack for each family member, flash lights and batteries, Copies of your personal identification (Driver's licenses, passports, school IDs, anything), matches, a hatchet for cutting wood, aspirin/basic pain reliever and fever reducer.

I'd be careful with anything that is a weapon. While it may help protect you from your neighbors or other refugees seeking to take advantage of your situation, it may also mark you as a potential danger/combatant and could get you shot. In numerous wars, civilians with rifles were often seen as francs-tireurs or partisans and often arrested, executed, or driven away. This is generally frowned upon and often considered a war crime (unless you can prove that the partisan was shooting at you), but that's not much help for you, when you're shot just because you had a hunting rifle strapped to your back.

You want to make sure you can carry things and still walk, so don't over pack. But you need enough supplies (food and water) to get to somewhere ""Safe."" That's going to depend wildly on where you are and how far you can walk. Ideally you can just stay in your home and avoid trouble, but worse case scenario, you need to leave.

It's winter there, and I live in Minnesota so I know a bit about cold winters. I won't go too much over it, you know it as well, but warm clothes, layers, jackets, and good gloves/mittens will go a long way in the cold. Avoid getting wet, and if your feet get wet, find a place to stop ASAP and get them both dry and warm. You may need to have multiple pairs of socks to prevent both frostbite as well as trench foot (a condition where the foot is trapped in cold, wet conditions and acquires a variety of terrible diseases and potentially can cost you your foot or even life).

Before even prepping, why not look long and hard on why you should stay.  Whats keeping you in that location that you cant do elsewhere?  If war doesnt break out, you can always come back.  I would recommend figuring out a place you can go first and make a plan to get there and what you'll do when you get there.  Then stock up on canned goods, water, basic medical kit, and a way to cook food.  A water purification system of some kind is great as well but should not be used to bunker down with.

4- Hide your valuables and cash somewhere not obvious.
5- Keep the beds away from the windows.
6- If you take meds, stock up.
7- Avoid rooftops and balconies if you hear something like shooting or bombing.
8- Sometimes walking is a much better way to stay safe than running. This is a very important thing that not many people talk about. If the masses are running, joining them isn't the best idea. Walking away could save your life. It saved mine. Chasers and shooters focus on runners. Unless we're dealing with a sniper.
9- Stock up on wet wipes. They can help a lot if water is cut off for days.
10- Avoid arguments with the family. Mental health would not take both war and family fights.

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu1bd2s,"First up, consider evacuating. 

If you live somewhere near a strategic target, consider shoring up doors and windows against small-arms fire. Be cautious with this though, as it's a bit of a compromise. If you barricade too much, you might send the signals that you've prepared a fighting position. 

Consider your escape plan if the building's integrety is threatened. Make sure you have smoke alarms with batteries in them, and that everyone in the family knows where the emergency is. Make sure every bed in the household has an electric torch next to it, and a spare set of batteries.

Bottled water will only last so long. Also invest in some filters and some means of purifying water. This could be puri-tabs, iodine, boil and condensing it. Water should be one of your biggest priorities. Cholera and other waterborne diseases were one of the most dangerous aspects of the US campaign against Iraq.

If you'll be cooking by unfamiliar means indoors (like a camping stove) have a fire extinguisher to hand.

Make sure you have a decent first aid kit in the home, and know roughly how to use it.

Make sure all mobile phones are charged fully whilst the electricity is on. If it goes off, make sure that the phones are only used for necesary comms. Switch off unneeded services such as bluetooth and GPS (when not out and about). 

If you need to navigate, try to have a paper based map, and some knowledge of how to read it. GPS may or may not work under conditions of foreign military occupation.

If you have a vehicle, make sure it's serviced, full of fuel and used to bare minimum, as you don't know when fuel will become scarce.

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu0wawl,"heat, food, clean water, clean air, shelter, protection, and medical care

You need a plan for how you will be providing these things for yourself and any potential family. 

Heat - can be made with electricity, but it may not be available. Can you start a fire? Can you make your fire discreet? Do you have a box of matches or a ferro rod that will last? Where will you get burnable matter? 

Food - can be stored beforehand if you have a place to keep it. Ensure you can get back to this place if so. Small animal traps are incredibly reliable if the local ecosystem can support them.  You may need/be able to steal food from closed businesses or abandoned houses. If you have a firearm, you may be able to claim a larger animal. If you do, try to smoke it into basically jerky, that will last the longest without refrigeration. 

Clean water - this is easy in the modern era. Worst case you can find running water, filter it through sand and moss, and boil it. Best case you can buy a lifestraw and they are good for like 10000 gallons of even the nastiest water or something. 

Clean air - this may not apply depending on your circumstance. if you are going to bunker underground, this is priority #1. Bad air can kill you before you even realize it, snd it’s invisible. 

Shelter - are you going to bunker in a permanent location? If not, do you have a tent? Can you build a lean to shelter in the wilderness? Know where you can go in an emergency

Protection, any weapon is better than no weapon, worst case you can find and sharpen a long stick. Guns are the best choice, provided you have ammo. Other than that a large knife is really solid. If you have a permanent shelter and are in danger of being attacked, taking the time to set traps is a great idea. 

Lastly, medical care - stock up on common medicine if possible, bandages and a disinfectant are top tier life savers. Other than that this will vary wildly depending on the situation, so just make sure to keep it in mind. 


The long story short is that there are a lot of ways to stay safe and provide for yourself. The big part is to have a plan, set it up before you need it, and be ready to execute at a moments notice.

Edit: an emergency radio and some flares might be a good idea.",IncompetentFrog,44,2022-01-24 14:54:55

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu0wdn9,"What everyone else has said is good, but a food dehydrator and some stasher bags may give you the most bang for your preparation buck. You can dehydrate meats, veggies, fruits, etc. that will then last for ages without refrigeration. When you have access to water and a fuel source you can cook them up, but otherwise they’re good as jerky! 

If you think you’ll be able to boil some water, camping meals from places like Mountain Home are delicious and filling. MREs have the heating implement built in. 

As far as meds go, if you can get your hands on some broad spectrum antibiotics, that would be ideal. Z-packs, penicillin, stuff like that. For injuries, pick up Wound Wash or Betadine rather than Hydrogen Peroxide. Grab anything sterile you can. Look into steri-strips and butterfly bandages which can be used instead of stitches. I like nonadhesive pads and tape more than bandaids because it fits more sizes. Get tampons! They plug a bullet wound better than anything else! Get a pair of paramedic shears- those SOBs can cut through a penny. Grab an ace wrap as well. While the internet is still available, familiarize yourself with how to use all of this stuff. 

This looks like a lot, but you don’t need a ton of anything, and most of it will last a while. Gauze and tape are what you’ll go through the fastest.

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu18fw9,"I’m certainly not an expert, and you’ve gotten some good answers here so far! I wanted to add that in addition to planning for short term survival stuff in the event that water and electricity is cut out, I would plan for several months of difficulty getting most goods. 

So for example, if the power were to suddenly go out and you were unable or unwilling to go outside, you of course want foods you can eat without cooking (lots of peanut butter and crackers would be good, applesauce, soups, granola bars, etc.) plenty of water, and I would probably prioritize warm clothing and maybe a small tent over a way to start a fire inside. An indoor fire can become quite dangerous. 

But in addition to that stuff, sit down with your family and talk about what the necessary items are that you use over six months time, that would be very difficult or dangerous to go with out. Here I’m talking about filling prescription medications for example, and ask for a three month supply maybe. Do you have women in the home who need to stock up on menstrual products? Do you need to stock up on birth control or condoms? Toilet paper, soap, trash bags, these are the types of things that might be tricky to get later if there are supply chain issues due to a conflict. 

If you have children in the house, go grab plenty of crayons and coloring books, puzzles, legos, etc. the types of things that can occupy a lot of time if school is canceled. For adults, maybe get some board games like monopoly, chess, or checkers. Mental health is an important aspect of your wellbeing.  

And then on an even more sobering note, I think anytime you anticipate conflict, you must be willing and equipped to walk a long distance. It could be to stores because gas is hard to come by, or it could be to another town, or even further…. Make sure everyone in the family has good shoes, a new pack of socks that you do not open unless you have to leave, back pack for supplies, and a tent.",None,25,2022-01-24 16:16:08

NoStupidQuestions,How to prepare your house for an active wartime?,sbmt6d,hu176uc,"Sorry mate,  but my warning to everyone else reading this thread is **by the time you are in OPs situation it is already too late!**

Having a self-sufficient supply of water, heat, food, and medicine for an indefinite period of time requires  many different supplies, tools, and pieces of equipment. These things take a significant amount of time and money to acquire even when diaster isn't imminent, but in OPs situation (possible war any day now) these things will be **impossible** to get because *everyone else is scrambling for them too.*

You CANNOT wait until a disaster is at hand to stock up, because everyone else will be doing the same thing. **You must prepare ahead of time.**

Anyone else worried about a similar situation in their country should start preparing NOW. Get a hand-pumped well, or buckets for collecting rainwater, and purification tablets. Get a wood stove or camp stove to cook on. Stock up on sealed buckets of rice and beans, which can last years. Etc.

Be ready now, because later is too late

So given the sales numbers, and the cost of new production lines, most companies opt not to put pockets in women's clothing.

If women want pockets, only buy clothes with pockets and let the other clothes stagnate on the shelves.  The companies are only looking at what makes money, and pockets for women ain't it.

I went to school for Interdisciplinary Design, and this was a class on the history of Design.

So the origins of women's pant not having pockets goes back to the start of women being allowed to wear pants. As you could guess there was a lot of resistance against women wearing pants and originally it was only allowed in the house when she was home alone, or only her husband was present. Slowly this changed (with a lot of struggle) to women being allowed to wear pants outside of the house. Pants were made that resembled skirts, so like picture long flowy wide legs.

But there was one stipulation. They couldnt have pockets. And the reason being that if a women had pockets she could carry her own money, and be independant from her husband.

Which is actually what caused the creation of the purses, but I digress. 

So this was the reason up until women started wearing jeans. Then it evolved from not being able to carry money to the women's figure being outlined. Jeans were the first pants that really showcased the curves of a womans figure. If the pockets were too big then she could put big bulky things in them and it disrupted her perfect silhouette.

And that's still the issue. Things take a long time to change, even fashion norms.

NoStupidQuestions,"If women want real pockets in their clothing, why don’t some company just do as they say and make a shit ton of profit?",jh9fsk,g9z4l4b,"I’m a tailor. Have been for 28 years.

The market for women to have pockets emerged again a few years ago with deep pocketed dresses and skirts. Further, bridal designers have also installed pockets in their gowns, as my team and I have seen an increase in, recently. 

However, there’s less of a market for larger pockets for women in other types of clothing because:

a: they generally carry a bag or a purse with them, negating the need for functional pockets.

b: the tighter fit of women’s jeans and pants cause a noticeable line that is considered undesirable.

I’ve closed the pocket openings and removed the internal fabric from countless pants and jeans in my time, and each time the sentiment is the same. “I’ll never use them, and they’re useless anyway.”

Also, there is an entire subtype of lingerie that give only bare coverage where needed so they can simply not show undergarment lines under their clothing - i.e. Thongs.

Obviously if women had larger pockets, they wouldn’t feel the need to carry bags as much. But it’s my understanding as a career tailor that these are the two major answers.",tailoraaron,25,2020-10-25 00:10:03

NoStupidQuestions,"If women want real pockets in their clothing, why don’t some company just do as they say and make a shit ton of profit?",jh9fsk,g9xhlsa,"I'm late, but as a guy who wears womens' jeans, I can actually answer this question.

So you ask me why I wear them? I will tell you. 26x30 jeans are impossible to find for men. Thank God for American Eagle every so often. But I have to say, men's jeans in that size (for my size 6'1"" and 175) don't look good. 

Women's jeans: The front pockets are smaller, if they're even functional. This is because they're supposed to be more form-fitting. The fly is also much shorter on many of them, Levis especially, so you have to be careful there. 

Jeans are low, mid, and high-rise. Mid works for men. High rise jeans don't always have pockets and would look dumb with shit in the front pocket and probably be uncomfortable having a jagged item poking out, wearing out, and sticking into your belly.

Low-rise jeans are too low to have a working pocket. 

Mid-rise actually works and *could* have deeper front pockets, but not by much. Again, the shape of the hips is different, more wide than long, so the pockets need to be more proportional. 

Then you come to the back pockets. This is why I'm not a fan of men's jeans:

My ass looks fucking terrible in them.

Straight-up, my ass looks awesome in women's jeans because the back pocket is smaller and the ""seat"" is higher. In men's jeans, there's extra material there that hangs down, which causes a loose fit and looks bad. But it also makes them harder to keep up. They want to sag there. 

Women might say they want real pockets, but more importantly they want jeans that fit them properly. You can interpret that to mean ""look"", but feel and fit are important. For a woman's shape and requirements, jeans with a wider, shorter cut fit better and large pockets would look goofy or cause them to be ill-fitting.

EDIT: I should add that a man's wallet won't fit in the back pocket of women's jeans.

NoStupidQuestions,"If women want real pockets in their clothing, why don’t some company just do as they say and make a shit ton of profit?",jh9fsk,g9xbms6,"We know. This has been asked again and again almost every six months In different subreddits

It is because women don't want pockets. Which is proven by the fact that nobody is making such clothes. And people have tried. Some women do want pockets and it is funny to talk about it on the Internet, but women generally avoid buying such clothes. They look for different things. Not pockets.

Update
I noticed your question makes the assumption that women want pockets. This seems not to be true. Some do and there are some clothes for women that do have pockets. Formulating the question assuming the proposition is true makes it sound like a really I retesting question, but once you drop the assumption you are left with the fact.",rrzibot,3,2020-10-24 16:29:37

And honestly, be glad.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14ftkh,"I worked as a nurse on a oncological ward and have some experience with palliative care. 

Dying, especially from cancer, is a process that takes time. Most of the time, you won't feel too bad. Given your medication is managed well, you shouldn't be in too much pain. 

Most of the patients spend their last weeks very mindful. They took their time to sort out their personal affairs, said goodbye to loved ones. 

They also like to be as independently as possible, taking their time to do as much as possible themselves. 

From my experience their view towards the world shifts, they gain a whole new perspective, on a spiritual and emotional level. They live their lives until the end and make it count. Most of the patients have been extraordinarily kind and caring. 

On a physical level there is if course the constant decline in abilities. You'll have to accept that at some point you'll be bed bound and rely on other people's help. 

There will be issues like constipation or soreness in your mouth, fatigue. You'll spend a lot of your time sleeping and little tasks will be very exhausting for you. You won't have much appetite.

When it comes to dying itself, you won't have to worry. Your body knows what to do. It is a process that can take days, you'll just be asleep for a long time, you don't want to eat or drink anymore, you don't want to have a lot of interaction with other people anymore. 

Some people get very anxious, but as for the pain, there are meds that can ease that anxiety and help you relax. A palliative nurse will notice your anxiety even if you aren't able to tell her anymore, as you can tell from the body movements, and give you medication to help you. 

Before you actually die, you won't be in a conscious state anymore. It will feel more like a deep sleep. You won't be awake and telling people goodbye, as in the movies. 

I am very sorry for what you are facing. 
I know you don't want anything sugar coated, I just tell you the truth as I know it. 

It won't be that bad for yourself, you will be able to manage. And in the end you have no more strength left and you will just accept and even welcome the fact that it's now over. It's going to be bad for your loved ones, but that's why you will say goodbye to them in the weeks to come.",Beleruh,5091,2021-06-09 06:14:46
NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h149svs,"I was seconds from drowning a few years back. Whitewater kayaking with the wrong gear in icy water when you're not a strong swimmer will do that.

Death itself, I can't tell you, as I survived to type this. However, if it's at all helpful, I wasn't afraid. I was a bit frustrated at being dragged along the bottom of the river unable to get to the surface, but not long after, the little bit of panic subsided & I became quite calm. I briefly worried for my children, then remembered I have a lot of life insurance & the rest of the family would see to their well being. My life didn't flash before my eyes, per se, but the thoughts I did have were rapid fire.

I accepted my fate, relaxed, & let go. I was running out of oxygen. I closed my eyes & could feel my life starting to fade. For the first time in many years, I was at peace.

Then the current shifted, shot me back to the surface, & once I was getting air again, my survival instinct kicked back in. But before that, I was at peace. It felt like allowing myself to fall asleep, more than anything. The lead up when I knew I was in danger but thought I could survive was scary as hell. When I was certain I wouldn't, it was relaxing & peaceful. No doubt, that was the result of oxygen deprivation. Given it's your lungs that are failing you, you'll likely experience similar oxygen deprivation, then you'll just drift away.

Death is terrifying for everyone, I'm sure, but nearly losing my life due to a lack of oxygen was painless & oddly comfortable. I can only hope that when your time comes, you feel the same comfort I felt when you realize it's over.

I wish I could say more, or something better. But nobody truly knows what death is like. Even those of us who've knocked on death's door probably don't really know. But, of all the ways my life has nearly ended (I've had many close calls), that was perhaps the best way to go.

I hope that helps give you some kind of comfort or acceptance. Given I don't have a psych degree, I'm not sure what else I can do for you, but I hope this gives you something.

Edit: This got far more attention than I intended. I may not be able to answer everyone's questions, as this was never meant to be about me. It was the only way I knew of to help OP understand what may be coming. I hope some others with similar yet different experiences can share to give OP some peace of mind. I doubt any of us can make the terminal nature of OP's illness better for them, but hopefully we can bring some kind of comfort to them.",None,3365,2021-06-09 05:02:45
NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14aue3,"In cases like yours, it's the doctor's job to make sure you're comfortable and in as little pain as possible when you pass. As your body weakens, you'll likely lose consciousness first. At this point, the doctors will be able to see you slipping as your vital signs weaken. It's possible that you'll pass very quickly after you lose consciousness. If it looks like it's going to take a while, the doctors will administer painkillers and tranquilizers. The painkillers will help make sure you aren't in pain, and the tranquilizers will help you to go peacefully, hopefully avoiding seizures as your nervous system shuts down.

Once you lose consciousness, it's unlikely that you'll be aware of the world around you. You might dream, you might not. The important thing is that you shouldn't feel any pain, and with the doctor's aid you should be able to just peacefully slip away.

One final note, when people are very near death, they often seem to know its coming. And from what I've gathered from my family members in the medical field, it will be easiest not to fight it when the time comes, just let it take you.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14b2cm,"Physical decline? As things progress, you’ll have periods of increased somnolence. Some days you’ll have the energy to chat and eat and drink and other days you’ll be so exhausted you can’t think of anything else but sleep. Palliative medications can help with comfort. Hydromorphone or Morphine will likely be discussed for symptom management. 
“Experts” say hearing is the last sense to go so I always tell my palliative patients families to always talk to their loved ones. As they go deeper into sedation, sometimes people need to hear “it’s okay to go” some patients need to hear that reassurance that everyone one around them will be okay without them. Keeping palliative patients comfortable is always the goal. However, some patients can experience hypo or hyper delirium and that can be hard to control sometimes. But as long as you have competent doctors and nurses, you should kept as comfortable as possible for a gentle approach to end of life.",Cpt_Sparkle_Fingers,875,2021-06-09 05:16:52

She hadn't received any treatment and wasn't in a hospital when it happened, so no morphine or anything to help with the pain. It was stage 4 breast cancer that had moved into her lymph nodes, spine, and lungs. At the beginning of the night, she was speaking and making jokes, albeit slowly and with labored breath, but as the night progressed, she started to deteriorate quickly. She wanted a bath, and her friend brought her to the tub. She was vomiting and in a lot of pain, but then her mind took over. She told me that she was inside a rose, and it was soft and lovely. A peach rose. The hallucination made her feel better and I imagine helped with the pain. We got her back into bed, and she came back to us for a little bit, but then the oxygen deprivation won. She started gasping for air and making these sounds I can't properly describe. By that time, the ambulance had arrived, she was taken to the hospital, where she was only kept alive by them manually pumping her lungs. So we let her go.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h148r0a,"Organs failing, slowly feeling yourself lose strength and all that other fun stuff doesn’t feel good that’s for sure. It’s kinda of like when your in a dream and trying to run and you just don’t seem to move. I’d imagine that is what it feels like to be dying. 

Losing autonomy and all that jazz is gonna suck. With your case your gonna feel stiffness and swelling in your lungs, across your chest etc. it’s going to hurt to move, walk and even breathe. A lump near the surface of the skin is common, a fever that doesn’t break and broken bones caused by tumours growing is part of the parcel that is Ewing’s. 

But all of this knowledge is just a stone throws away if you used google so I’m guessing you must want something else. 

Death is death. It’s something that it doesn’t matter how much money you have or how much fame it will eventually come for you. People always think of death as some evil figure but I like to think that death is more of a deity which wants you to live and wants you to power through all that life throws at you because it knows that it is inevitable and you will meet it at the end of the story. 

Many people claim that when death catches up to you, one may see there god or something magical happens and there transported to another world to be it’s hero and that might all be possible. It also might be possible nothing happens and it all fades to black. In both cases this is a good thing. The former means you move onto another form of life and living while the latter means an end to your suffering. Death is moving on from this plain of existence and I’m not being religious or super scientific about it. It is really just moving on.

Everything you’re going through is daunting and reaching out to the people around you may seem harrowing but when your living day by day not knowing when the end is just make those final human connections to carry you into the next phase because that may be all you take with you. Try not to go into the light with any regrets weighing you down. Talk to friends and family and anyone that brings you happiness. The ones you leave behind will also feel affected by your passing. Let them remember someone inspiring that brings joy and meaning to there life. My grandfather always said he never wanted anyone to feel pity for him and I’m sure you feel the same.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14dy02,"3 perspectives. Myself... nearly drowning in lifeguard training due to someone else accidentally damaging me during a drill. The pain I should have felt in my lungs slowed down. Felt frustration, but just sorta gave up. While this was done in 5 minutes or less before waking up (wasn't passed out, but sorta... came to) on the side of the pool like nothing happened.   


My grandmother. Her systems just... shut down (old age). For about two weeks she was just... laying in her bed. No IV's, or anything, but not really eating or moving. Slowly speaking. Dazed. She did not seem to be in pain, but sorta... half asleep and awake all the time. She passed while I was in the room and I didn't even really know until the machines told me. Although she wasn't senile, her last days seemed like she didn't want to wake from a really intense nap. 

My friend Ashley (not her real name). Cancer at 23. Dead at 25. She was... unrecognizable. Swollen, changed. All the IV's and machines hooked up. She was comatose for months. The hospital made no secret of the fact that they were keeping her alive to study the final stages of her specific cancer. She was unresponsive, but her family decided to keep her alive (barely) so progress could be made in research. Nobody knows what she felt during this time. CAT scans and brain function suggested she felt nothing and was functionally dead before her body gave out weeks later. But we don't know. When she was conscious and talking she would not speak of pain, just fatigue and frustration and confusion. The decision to allow herself to be kept 'alive' after hope was going was partially hers.   


Make your wishes known.. ahead of time. If you are confused or frustrated and strange people are smiling at you, take it at face value, at people trying to help, people desperate to help and who care more than maybe you'll remember at the time.",personguy,232,2021-06-09 05:51:06
NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14bdcr,"Death is easy. It’s life that’s hard. I see death as somewhat of a reward. It’s really shitty that it’s happening so young for you, but think of life in more than your human terms. Time is relevant. Dogs get 10 years, some bugs get 24 hours. It’s not the time, it’s what you did with it. Death is also as natural to your existence as birth, it’s the path paved by every person, plant or animal that has ever existed. 

As for the actual process, well, I have watched a few people die. My father had brain cancer and he went into a coma a few days before he passed. This is common for cancer patients, and you will be well medicated. Just before he passed, he opened his eyes and despite his family being in the room, he looked to an empty corner, smiled and took a final breath. I don’t know what that means, we speculated that it may have been someone we lost earlier to show him the way. I don’t know, but I think it’s a part of the reason I don’t fear death. Whatever it was, he was happy to see it.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14ctkp,"I don't know if this will help or not. I copied this from a Hospice site. Dying is different for everyone, just like sickness is different from everyone. Nobody really knows what dying feels like because the person is shutting down and can't really describe what they are feeling. Pain can be helped with pain medication to keep a person comfortable. I think the final days/hours a person falls into a coma because their brain and organs are shutting down and you drift away in your sleep. 

The following describes the physical symptoms people have observed a dying person to have. Here are end-of-life signs and helpful tips:  
  
**Coolness**. Hands, arms, feet, and legs may be increasingly cool to the touch. The color of the skin may change and become mottled.

  
**Confusion**. The patient may not know time or place and may not be able to identify people around them. 

  
**Sleeping.** An increasing amount of time may be spent sleeping. The person may become unresponsive, uncommunicative, and difficult to arouse. How you can help: Sleeping more frequently is normal. You can sit quietly with them. Speak in a normal voice. Hold their hand. Assume they can hear everything you say. They probably can.  
Incontinence. They may lose control of urinary/bowel functions. This is a common end-of-life change that can occur during the process of passing on. 

  
**Restlessness**. The person may make repetitive motions such as pulling at the bed linen or clothing. This is due in part to A decrease in oxygen. 

  
**Congestion.** There may be gurgling sounds inside the chest. This is also sometimes referred to as a ""Death Rattle."" These may be loud. This end-of-life symptom does not indicate the onset of severe pain.

  
**Urine decrease**. Output may decrease and become tea colored. 

  
**Fluid and food decrease.** Your loved one may want little or no food or fluid. The body will naturally conserve energy required for the task ahead. Food is no longer needed. 

  
**Change in breathing.** The person may take shallow breaths with periods of no breathing for a few seconds to a minute. They may experience periods of rapid, shallow panting. These patterns are common and indicate decrease in circulation.

  
**Fever.** Increase in temperature is common.",Artistic_Hobby,144,2021-06-09 05:37:19
NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14hcl1,"I am a junior doctor working in palliative care, and I have seen more people die in the last few months than I probably would in my entire career. Ultimately, palliative care is all about providing patients with a 'good death' and it means different things for different people. Most patients with us have metastatic cancers. Less common would be end stage COPD and strokes. It's best to speak to your oncologist but hopefully I can help.

Death is both different and similar for everybody. I'll explain. We often talk about the Karnofsky  and the PACA scores for each patient on the ward round. Both of these tend to indicate what the general condition is. The Karnofsky in particular can give you an idea of how the body declines physically. Below are the links:

https://www.mdcalc.com/karnofsky-performance-status-scale

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.nwcscnsenate.nhs.uk/files/2714/3394/6192/Fatigue.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjOqo3n6onxAhUM4OAKHYnhDvsQFjAEegQIGRAC&usg=AOvVaw2isXlXKJGTlB48B40Lqghc&cshid=1623217323883


Patient's symptoms differ depending on their cancer and where it has spread. If it is in the bones, you tend to get bone pain. Each type of pain has different characteristics and it is difficult to describe. However, if the bone is 'weak' you can get pathological fractures which can cause spikes in pain as you can imagine. If the tumor/swelling from the cancer/bone impinge on nerves, you may get sensation changes +/- weakness +/- neuropathic pain.

However, these can be managed with medications which reduce swelling, strengthen bones, and proper analgesia. The silver lining is that as your body deteriorations, you will feel less and less of these symptoms. All patients, who are slowly deteriorating, reach a point where all active treatment is stopped and focus is put on anticipatory medications. These are the ones that keep a person comfortable in the terminal stages, and tend to deal with pain, anxiety, seizures, secretions, nausea, vomiting, mouth care, etc. They work very well! 

The terminal phase of the deterioration or dying, is where things tend to be similar. If the symptoms are well managed, people become weaker and weaker. They will sleep more and more through the day, sometimes the whole of 24hrs. They will likely lose all appetite, and stop eating and drinking. They will likely become unconscious. Their breathing becomes erratic and noisy, which may be distressing to people around you but the person is usually not registering it by that point. But usually, these are not uncomfortable for the patient, and tend to pass away very peacefully. This is a very much a summarised version of what happens.

Death, if well managed, is a very peaceful process.

What you should focus on now is making plans. Whenever we clerk our patients in, we discuss with them about their medical bits, but also about their spirituality, religion, family dynamics, preferred place of care and death (home, hospice, etc), who is important to them, who we should keep in the loop, organ donation, genetic sampling, and what their goals and expectations are, among other things. 

If you'd like, these can all be worked into an ""Emergency health care plan (EHCP)"" or an ""Advanced directive"". You can also think about ""Lasting power of attorney"" (appointing someone who can legally make decisions on your behalf). A ""DNAR (do not attempt resus)"" is also important, this one is put in place by a doctor, hopefully, after a discussion with you. 

This is probably too much information to take in right now. Sorry. 

Spend some quality time with the people you care about. I am really sorry about what you're going through, and I wish you all the best.

He was tired and dosed a great deal. I remember him telling me all of my life when I was tired. ""Gnat, you'll sleep when you're dead. Let's keep going."" He did that until his wings arrived. When he woke up, he talked. If you have things to say, stay up. Docs will keep you comfortable.

The toughest part for him was being physically changed. He was a 30-yr USN veteran. This was not how he wanted to end.  I wiped him  clean for the last time. Be prepared to depend on people for your basic needs.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14mkyj,"The answer to this question can largely depend on the kind of treatment you opt for - ICU and full code vs. palliation at home are entirely different things - different pain, levels of awareness, medications, interventions, yadda yadda. I hope there is a palliative team consulted for you already. If there isn’t, please ask for one. Any doctor you see should be able to discuss death, but the palliative care folks often have more time to talk/experience with death, which translates to attentive and compassionate care. Never be afraid to ask for a second opinion. Ask lots of questions. Ask about intubation and resuscitation. You only die once. Do it the way you like. If you haven’t yet, then whenever you are ready, ask your medical team to go through appropriate documentation with you in order to clarify your wishes. You are the driver, and everyone else is along for the ride. 
I cannot get in my patients’ heads, but I will say that it can be very frustrating to see patients eternally left on the vent because their family is (understandably) experiencing guilt about discontinuing care, despite no hope of improvement. Sometimes less care is more, even though goodbyes may arrive rudely before we are prepared for them. Fortunately, we now have many helpful continuous medications to remove feelings of panic, and to ease you into a sleep. Dying in our era can be much kinder than in many eras preceding ours. I’m so horribly sorry that your goodbyes are not coming on the schedule you expected, and I’m sorry that is out of your control.

NoStupidQuestions,What does dying feel like?,nvn4nx,h14g3jd,"It’s odd, because I have always been terrified of my own death, but when I was dying, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought.

I have nearly died on a few occasions. Just unlucky I guess. Once, when I was a child, I was nearly drowned when an older kid decided to hold me underwater. When I was a young teen, I developed a severe lung infection and had to be kept on several antibiotics to stay stable. And most recently, I had my heart stop and restart before the age of 20. (A genetic arrhythmia previously unbeknownst to me, exacerbated by a medication I was already on).

In every situation, I was scared at first. When I thought I was going to die, I would fight and fight. But my energy would decrease. My heart would struggle to keep going. That’s the one thing I’d say is unusual when you know you are about to die- I was so keenly aware of my heart that I felt it everywhere in my body. I grew tired of fighting though. In every situation, I just kind of... gave up. I was done. My body was done. I didn’t have the will to fight what was happening to me anymore, which made me unbearably sad for a few seconds. I was sad that I was giving up, and a little angry, but then I was at peace. I thought about everything in life that had made me happy. 
I thought about people I loved, and how lucky I was to meet them. I thought about my dog and my partner. I even thought about my coworkers. I decided I was ok with dying, and let go. From there on out, I just felt patient and tired. I had all the time in the world to wait to die, and it would happen when it happened. I closed my eyes and waited to go. 

I don’t know what to say to you. I have been dying, but never dead. And while my time is borrowed to a certain extent, my circumstances are not like yours. Physically, I’m sure you’re going to get a lot of really smart and thoughtful responses on here. Emotionally, I can only tell you what I experienced. I went through the fearful, fighting stage, realized I was going to die; sadness and anger for a few seconds and then a peaceful release and patient wait for death. When I was closest to death, I mostly felt tired, patient, and calm. I was ready to go.

I hope that we’ve helped you get ready as best we can.",Theverylastbraincell,19,2021-06-09 06:18:19

I cant determine exactly what itll look like for you, but often people who go gradually are drugged to shit.  Its progressive.  As the symptoms worsen the medication increases.

Medically speaking, if you are considered palliative, nurses can give you hydromorphone or whatever ( this may vary by location im in canada).   If they see you in pain you get more meds.  As you get closer to the end youll be so out of it that it wont even matter. 

If you have no qualms id recommend this approach.  I wouldnt want to be around for the last bit.  It looks shittt.  Your body will go unconscious anyways or your heart will stop.

[Cat vision in daytime isn't as good as humans](https://pictures-of-cats.org/cat-vision-pictorial-examples.html), and humans are specifically evolved to recognize human faces.  You can see this all the time with dogs, because dogs express their emotion pretty loudly.  If a dog sees you through the window, and can't hear or smell you, they have a confused look like they aren't sure whether to bark or greet you. 

Dogs and cats both recognize smell more than anything, then voice and pattern of movement, appearance least of all.  Your cat probably was confused.

When we were moving out of our first house the neighbors came over and one of the first things they said upon seeing our moving truck was, ""Aw, are you taking Tommy with you?"" I had no idea what they were talking about. ""Tommy, your gray tabby. He comes over for dinner every day.""

THEFUCKAREYOUTALKINGABOUT! He does WHAT!? I feed that cat two meals a day AND he hunts and eats field critters all night. And you're telling me he's been coming to your house for two years for EXTRAS? And his name is Chips. He sleeps in my bed. Actually, on my face.

But seeing each other outside was never a problem. He LOVED outside time with us. It took me too long to realize it and we only got a couple years of outside playtime with him. He would walk to the neighborhood mailboxes with us. He would roll in the grass in the front yard with us. He would climb the trees and stalk us.

It started one day when he meowed at the front door and I let him out. Then he immediately meowed to come back in. When he immediately wanted back out I was frustrated, but as soon as he stepped out he turned around and meowed back at me. So I stepped outside and shut the door, ""NOW WHAT."" He walked a few steps, looked back and meowed. I so walked to him and he kept walking. We explored the front yard and had a great time.

If that doesn’t work, a funny conversation comparing drivers licence photos. 
Or student cards. 

Be careful with the ID option - people don’t always go with their legal names. 

If you’re friendly, offer to review their resume for them, and ask them to look at yours (cant hurt)..

Ask if they had a nickname in childhood. And where it came from.

These tricks work better if you at one point knew their name and have forgotten. You’ll be reminded. 


Bet a stranger in a bar $20 they can’t get a full name, including middle name.

And it's not the parent or the teacher who is setting those rules. 

I think a lot of people who think this isn't a big deal are likening it to a complaint about other subjects, where you can agree or disagree with what's being taught if your politics/religion/experiences/etc don't line up. But this is the purest evidence you're ever going to get that they will not reconsider their stance when it's challenged. Extend that into more serious and nebulous issues - bullying, etc - and you can (or should) see the problem.

These are the teachers/admin who are typically more concerned with 'maintaining authority' than about helping kids, and sometimes if you're the one comfortable pushing back against that then you're really helping the parents who might not be when their kid is being mistreated. Parents aren't always right, but neither are teachers, and the worst treatment of kids is when one of those groups doesn't acknowledge that.",malaphortmanteau,82,2023-12-01 12:00:26

Also think of this. They don't guarantee 100% percent accuracy, there are false positives and false negatives. Imagine two customers. One is trying to get pregnant, uses the test, and gets a negative. Sad for a while but then it will eventually turn out she is actually pregnant and all will be forgotten. The 2nd customer had a fling and is fearful hoping she is not pregnant. She sees a positive.This terrified feeling will be way more powerful and caustic than the former scenario. People will be mad at the company who lied to them that they weren't pregnant when they were, a fact they needed to know as early as possible, and these people will say the company was false advertising.

NoStupidQuestions,"Why do pregnancy test adverts never show a relieved young woman looking at a ""Not pregnant"" result?",acu3go,edb53cc,"I have a friend who is trying to get pregnant and is having a really difficult time. My understanding is that for a lot of couples, it's a lot harder to get pregnant and have a child survive until term than the media and others would lead you to believe. She is very sensitive about it, and I completely understand why. Going so far as to cut off social media because seeing other moms with their kids was making her really emotional on a lot of different levels. (Why isn't that me, What's wrong with me, etc. etc.)

I don't want kids. Ever. So I'd be the one who used the test hoping for a no result. However, beyond that very slim circumstance, I am not watching or caring about pregnancy test commercials. (TBH I'd be more likely to go to a doc for a blood test anyway because that's more reliable.)  People who actually want to have a baby are, because they want fast and accurate results. 

When I think about my friend who really wants a baby watching a commercial where a person celebrates getting a 'not pregnant' result, I can tell she would be upset. Not angry at the commercial, but moreso, yet again, reminded of how sad her circumstances are and kind of upset that a commercial is reminding her about it while also having a person *celebrating* not being pregnant. 

So it comes down to audience. I'm not watching those commercials as someone who doesn't want a baby, especially because I'm doubly responsible about birth control and would be at a doc in a flash if there were any signs there had been some kind of mishap. My hopeful pregnant-to-be friend is. And they want to advertise to her. And I'm fine with that. ",beepborpimajorp,4,2019-01-05 16:44:13

NoStupidQuestions,Could I survive the rest of my life (let's say 50 years) in an abandoned Walmart (All items are still there but it doesn't get any deliveries),d2f2bf,ezv3k37,"Assuming the electricity stays on you'd probably be able to make it for 50 years. You would exhaust your fresh food in under one month, but you could preserve some of it before it goes bad by scouring the store for tupperware containers and ziploc baggies - you could then preserve lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs, etc. After exhausting that food (probably 3 years worth) you would target canned/bottled food. The ""best by"" date for most canned and bottled food is about 2-3 years, and that's only the ""best to sell before"" date rather than the date the food goes bad. So for the next 5-8 years you'd target (no pun intended) all of the canned/bottled food in WalMart, and if you're smart you'd take some of that food and freeze it in the 1000s of Tupperware containers and ziploc baggies still available. This might add another 5 years.  After 19 years you'd start transitioning to the frozen goods still stored in the many freezers....it might taste stale or 'off' but there's no reason to think it would be dangerous. So a conservative estimate, based on a typical Walmart store size, is that you'd last another 5-8 years on frozen food alone which gets you to the 27 year time period. You'd then transition to dry goods like pasta, rice, beans, cereals, etc, which you would hopefully have moved into the freezers in order to stave off dry rot. Cooking all of this food would be made easy by the many microwaves, camp stoves, and even BBQs that you would have found (an indoor BBQ using propane gas cylinders would be reserved for special occasions...the size of the store would mean that vented BBQ gasses indoors would not be a particulalr problem). Assuming you originally enter the store in the spring or summer season, you'd find bags and bags of gardening soil, so you could improvise garden beds (using grow lamps found in the garden section) and extend your beans by growing indoors. 

Overall, I'm confident one person could last 50 years in an electrified Walmart. Without electricity I seriously doubt anyone could last longer than 5-10 years.",havereddit,6443,2019-09-11 01:44:41

Edit:

This is assuming the WalMart would have mice and rats, and that the canned goods would start to rust. The mice and rats would take care of the rice, beans, noodles, etc. in plastic bags. Canned foods in damaged cans (rust) will go bad. Yes, if you stored a case of canned Pork and Beans in a strictly temperature and humidity-controlled room it would last a long time. Under **normal** conditions, however, canned goods would go bad when the can went bad.

(2) Go to the summer section and grab the large inflatable pools

(3) Go to the hardware section and get several tarps

(4) Use steps #1-3 to create a self-sustaining terrarium, and use the potatoes, carrots and other vegetables in the grocery section as your plants

(5) The walmart also likely has some mice or rats - use non-lethal rat or mice traps from the pest aisle to trap them and then breed them for meat

(6) For water, I'm not quite sure ... I assume you can recycle urine, but you also have aisles full of liquid ... must be some way to make sure it doesn't sour ... I assume you would want to open all containers with liquid (soda, juice, etc) and burn off the sugar (which could spoil badly) and get pure water, and then store that as best as possible.  Would be interested to hear other strategies.

EDIT: On the water problem, I think the key is to act immediately while you still have access to electricity (for boiling) and that you should do the following:

* Take all the glass bottles in the store (the question is, are there enough - likely not)

* Take all the non pure water in the store (fruit juice, soda, etc)

* Boil the non pure water and capture the water vapor and store the water in the glass bottles

* Add iodine tablets (from the camping section - but again, are there enough)

* Store pure water in glass bottles in dark storage area out of the way

Others are saying that you can just rely on all the soda that will be in a walmart.  First, you need approximately 18K 2 liter bottles of soda to survive 50 years.  A regular walmart likely won't have that much (in my assumption, you do not have access to the back storage area).  Second, that soda will spoil due both to the sugar and more importantly the plastic storage.  Others say they would use rainwater.  In my assumption, you have no access to the outside, but if you can access the roof then obviously rainwater is the solution assuming there hasn't been some sort of radiation or similar contaminating event.",None,247,2019-09-10 22:58:13

That will give you time to start dehydrating all of the meat for later use. There are recipe books with the dehydrators so you know how much salt to use to keep it from spoiling.  Start dehydrating all the produce as well. Use the ovens in the bakery and deli set on low to get all that done. There are plenty of racks and trays to get a ton of it started on day 1. Use vacuum sealers to package everything, then store all that in big plastic totes stored in an area that you surround with insect and rat poison.

**No Power or Water:** Still get all the meat and dairy into the freezer. Take all the produce to the walk-in refrigerator. It'll last longer while you set up some drying racks on the roof. Use volleyball nets and fish nets to keep the birds off your food. Salt it heavily to keep pests off while it's drying. If there are any sunny windows set racks in front of them, too. Dehydrate as much food as you can in the few days you've got. Get some grills going to dehydrate food. Salt as much of the meat as you can to help preserve it.

Set up totes and play pools on the roof to collect rain water. Don't concentrate too much water collection in one area, or it'll cave in the roof.

Set up pools to grow gold fish larger. Might work.

Start farming. Use play pools and tarps to make garden beds filled with soil from the garden section. Read some books on gardening and get seeds started. Start composting your food scraps for eventual fertilizer needs...if you ever run out of the store bought stuff.

In an apocalyptic situation eventually you'll need to seal up all the toilets and drains with plastic to keep out sewer gas once the water in the traps evaporates.

Get good at catching rats to eat for protein. Those cans of chili aren't going to last forever, bud.

No matter what, figure out where you're going to dump trash and waste on day 1. Outside away from the building. If you're locked inside, get to the roof, and fling that shit as far as you can. Eventually you'll need to build a trebuchet to get some distance. Might need to keep a rifle handy to pick off the wild animals that will absolutely love your trash heap.

You've got a shit ton of work to do.

Edit: You can find books on canning next to mason jars. That's another solid way to preserve as much produce and meat as possible with the supplies on hand. Should give you another year of food storage. There may also be info on fermented foods like sourkraut and kimchi. You can ferment lots of foods to preserve them. Also, they may have sausage making kits. If so, you have another good avenue for preserving as much meat as possible. Plus, when the time comes you'll know just what to do with all that rat meat:-)

Edit 2: Speaking of fermentation, you can brew ciders and wines from a lot of the fruit on hand. Get that started too.

Food items aside, there are enough simple tools, clothing, and equipment in a Walmart Supercenter to keep dozens of people alive for 50 years. Even if you can't go out to hunt/fish/gather, maybe leave a door open, see what strolls in. There's a solid chance whatever walks in that door is, to varying degrees, going to be edible. Would that count as accepting a delivery though?

All I'm saying is 50 years is a long time to be eating whatever the hippies in Lawn & Garden are growing. And I can assure you it's not meat. There are already border skirmishes between Women's and Men's and, of course, Children's is gonna get the worst of it.

Just watched the martian so im a bit optimistic at the moment but 50 years is a long time. Growing crops would be a must and the garden section of walmart should provide adequate sunlight/shade. Limiting reactants such as water would likely kill you unless you had access to rain. Since its a hypothetical im going with the fact that you WILL have electricity despite being trapped. In that case you can work on beating every game on any platform you prefer while youre not eating/farming. Walmart sells guns so you can hunt any critters that cone and try to steal your food. So long as a diet of rats and potatoes doesnt give you some weird super aids, i think you could do it if you outlast suicide.

 Actually the more i think about it, if theres nobody else with you and after 50 years youre just freed, its basically just a prison with a LOT of shit to do. I would build a lego palace, play video games, get stupid high on whatever i can find in the pharmacy, eat all the pershishables i can in the first month, build a remote control car stunt course, shoot guns at random shit, maybe experiment with building some makeshift explosives, beat my meat, and kill myself.

Best strategy imo is ""Peace thru strength"". Convince people its safer to risk exploring elsewhere than confronting you. Find any dead bodies or fake some from decomposed meat & hang them outside on nooses with sign saying ""Looters or unwanted visitors will be shot"". Have as many men you have be seen on the rooftop. Have women dress as men if you need to. Find speakers & loop sounds from a movie that elevates the # of people you actually have inside (think Home Alone ""You filthy animal"" scene but on grander scale). Find a torture movie if you want to be real sadistic.

2) Next danger will be resource sappers that show up & tug at heartstrings (women, children, sick or old)

Maybe stage gardening as a quarantine area. Supply visitors w/ enough food & water for a few days. Enough that they travel far enough to become someone else's problem. Never let them gauge full size of your group.

3) Lastly my plan for those that return or visitors you want never to come back.

Stage some people in quarantine that are part of your group. Treat them like fellow travelers. Have the person who delivers food & aide to new visitors act kind but reserved, like they've been abused. Then at some point at night. The kind reserved person sneaks into quarantine to warn all visitors the men inside have mutinied & are planning to kill all visitors for food. Just then your group of men will barge in & attack the kind person, who's in on it. The people you have staged as fellow travelers will mock attack the men while shouting to the unwanted visitors to save themselves. Hopefully you will conveniently leave gates open for them to escape.",ben_franklin76,5,2019-09-11 06:10:11

ok, so all the perishable goods (fresh meat, eggs, veggies) are gonna go in... lets say 2-3 months with varying degrees

whats left are the canned goods but those expire too,so you will die in 10 years.

that is, unless you start a farm on the rooftop, which can be done using the soil, the tools and some seed from the Walmart.

I think it is kind of cultish because you literally pledge to put the existence of the state above yourself. It feels a kind of nationalistic propoganda to be honest.   
Moreover, it ends with this exclamation,

>""My existence shall be dedicated to the Turkish existence. How happy is the one who says ""I am a Turk!""

For many years this did not feel off to me; however, I feel conflicted now for I am actually a Circassian. And even though my ancestors came to this region in 19th century (they were exiled from their homeland after the conquest of Russia), The Turk in the pledge had the meaning of the people of Turkey initially; however, many nationalist does not solely think like that.",mitzionix,13,2020-12-05 17:52:33

Many rural schools and backwards parts of the country do require the pledge and if you don't do it you may be punished or looked down upon. However in other areas like cities where education is more important than indoctrination, the pledge isn't something that's done. The supreme court has said its not a requirement and people can't be made to do it but that doesn't mean school teachers, idiot principals, and other students won't punish people for not doing it. 

For the most part it's a k-8 type thing. Generally high schools don't do it however, again, that's a generalization. 

Yes as an adult its incredibly disturbing, however for the children doing it, it's not really anything. It doesn't mean anything to the children. It's just another bullshit thing that adults make them do.",OutlyingPlasma,7,2020-12-05 17:16:23

NoStupidQuestions,Why do we give children illusions about Santa etc on Christmas instead of telling them that you get your loved ones a gift? The latter seems more lovely and is actually the truth,jdz90t,g9bdbzn,"I used to think it was magical or just a bit of fun until I started teaching. Every year come January the kids would come in and start talking (sometimes bragging) about what Santa had given them. Sometimes Santa was extremely generous to certain children, others unfortunately not so much. You could see some of the other children who were ""good"" thinking to themselves ""why didn't I get as much as everyone else?"" It was actually a little heartbreaking.

Edit- Santa seems to be a really emotional subject still for a lot of people. My original comment was made quite casually.  I should clarify that I'm not suggesting we cancel Christmas. The issue I have is that we generally feed kids this idea that there is a godlike figure who will pass judgement on how good or bad you are, but then doesn't even follow his own rules, because he gave your bully more gifts than he gave you. I am not in denial that shitty things still happen to good people either. It's a big hot topic in schools right now to help children be resilient and we do that whenever opportunities arise.  But as adults we are in control of how we explain the mythology of Santa and set up whatever traditions we want to follow. Let's just be mindful and show a little empathy while we do so. At our house Santa gives one modest gift and fills your stocking, everything else is from family and friends. I really don't get people's logic that the wound is already there, so what's the harm in a little sprinkle of salt. Trust me, kids know early on where they all sit in the pecking order, all year round. They don't need the added salt.",83_RedBalloons,8436,2020-10-19 12:03:57

[The Secret of Santa](https://redtri.com/i-m-the-mom-behind-the-secret-of-santa/)

>In our family, we have a special way of transitioning the kids from receiving from Santa, to becoming a Santa. This way, the Santa construct is not a lie that gets discovered, but an unfolding series of good deeds and Christmas spirit.  
>  
>When they are 8 or 9—whenever you see that dawning suspicion that Santa may not be a material being— that means the child is ready.  
>  
>I take them out “for coffee.” We get a booth, order our drinks, and the following pronouncement is made:  
>  
>“You sure have grown an awful lot this year. Not only are you taller, but I can see that your heart has grown, too.” I point out 2-3 examples of empathetic behavior, consideration of people’s feelings, good deeds etc, the kid has done in the past year.  
>  
>“In fact, your heart has grown so much that I think you are ready to become a Santa Claus. You probably have noticed that most of the Santas you see are people dressed up like him. Some of your friends might have even told you that there is no Santa.  A lot of children think that, because they aren’t ready to BE a Santa yet, but YOU ARE.  
>  
>“Tell me the best things about Santa. What does Santa get for all of his trouble?"" We work our way from “cookies” to the good feeling of having done something for someone else. “Well, now YOU are ready to do your first job as a Santa!”  
>  
>Now for the fun part! Make sure you maintain the proper conspiratorial tone.  
>  
>We then have the child choose someone they know–a neighbor, usually. The child’s mission is to secretly, deviously, find out something that the person needs, and then provide it, wrap it, deliver it–and never, ever reveal to the target where it came from. Being a Santa isn’t about getting credit, you see. It’s about unselfish giving.  
>  
>My oldest chose the “witch lady” on the corner. She really was horrible–had a fence around the house and would never let the kids go in and get a stray ball or frisbee. She’d even yell at them to play quieter. He noticed that she came out every morning to get her paper in bare feet, so he decided she needed slippers.  
>  
>His next task was to go spy on her and decide how big her feet were. He hid in the bushes one Saturday, and decided she wore a medium, so we went and bought warm slippers. He wrapped them up, and tagged it “Merry Christmas from Santa.” After dinner, he slipped down to her house, and slid the package under her driveway gate.  
>  
>The next morning, we watched as she waddled out to get the paper, picked up the present, and went inside. My son could hardly contain his excitement, and couldn’t wait to see what would happen next. The next morning, as we drove off, there she was, out getting her paper–wearing the slippers. He was ecstatic. I had to remind him that NO ONE could ever know what he did, or he wouldn’t be a Santa.  
>  
>Over the years, he chose a good number of targets, always coming up with a unique present just for them. One year he chose the daughter of some friends of ours, who were going through some tough times. Christmas for them was looking pretty bleak. With the help of his father, he polished up his bike, put a new seat on it, and with her parents’ permission, placed it on their back porch. The look on her face when she saw the bike with a big bow on it was almost as good as the look on my son’s face.  
>  
>When it came time for Son #2 to join the ranks, my oldest came along, and helped with the induction speech. They are both excellent gifters, by the way, and never felt that they had been lied to—because, instead, they were let in on the Secret of Being a Santa.

As my siblings and I got older, and my older brother and I knew Santa wasn't real while one or both of my younger sisters still did, my mom used to say ""as long as there's a spirit of love in the world, there's a Santa Claus.""  What this lady did with her kids seems to demonstrate that in spades.  I think she successfully transitioned from the magic of Santa, to the magic of gifting selflessly. and she did so in such a way that the kid isn't going to tell his classmates that Santa doesn't exist.  Because Santa does exist, just within all of us.",bestem,1566,2020-10-19 13:17:26

The latter seems more lovely and is actually the truth,jdz90t,g9bkghj,"I was raised with no Santa. My mom did have to tell me other kids believed in him after I tried to let my best friend in on the secret. Anyway, my parents, the ever weird people that they are, and my aunt (also very weird) came up with a different magical Christmas deity, the Cosmic Christmas Jellyfish, when I was four. I'll explain the CCJ below because Santa probably would have been better. 

The Cosmic Christmas Jellyfish (CCJ for short) live deep below the ocean and sometimes comes out and flies in the sky leaving a colorful goo in his wake that some people mistake for the Northern Lights. He is a giant, colorful, magical flying jellyfish. 
To receive presents on Christmas you must do as follows:
1. Clean your room 
2. Leave a pistachio offering out for him 
3. Be asleep. 
If all of those things are done he will eat the pistachios and poop out your presents. 
If they are not, however, he will rip you limb from limb, eviscerate you, and leave your guts strewn about your room to be discovered in the morning.

I want my kids to feel loved, unconditionally.
And that is why when I think about it, giving gifts from Santa is actually a little bit selfish of me. But I’ll be darned if my kids don’t wake up happy every Xmas knowing that they are loved, with no one to thank for it. Because thankless love is in itself beautiful.

When it comes to why, it may have begun as a way to lift spirits, I’m not certain, but probably many can agree it was boosted for monetary reasons, as to why it continued after the initial push to make it a buying holiday I can only suspect it’s because it was also drilled into our heads by marketing that kids SHOULD believe.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do we give children illusions about Santa etc on Christmas instead of telling them that you get your loved ones a gift? The latter seems more lovely and is actually the truth,jdz90t,g9bd7oy,"Because in the west we live in a predominantly judeo Christian anglosphere that historically recognised Saint Nicholas as part of the celebrations of the Christian holy day as interpreted by the biblical account of christ (as opposed to the other abrahamic religions).

Ever since the enlightenment and the subsequent ""death of god"" phenomenon, the festival of ""christ's mas"" has gradually faded to little more than lip service to the original cultural purpose. Meanwhile, the increasing collective shift away from theological idealism and towards a materialist rational empiricism, along with the widespread adoption of a heavily neo liberal capitalist zeitgeist underpinned by a post modern form of pseudo-religious worship in brands and consumerism;

The black booted, red and white suited, big bearded, white haired fat old caucasian man we know as Santa Clause is actually a seasonal brand copyrighted by CocaCola, and the festival as it stands has been co-opted as a mass marketing campaign for businesses to exploit.

This is generally maintained by furthering the collection of brand symbols, themes and logos as associated with the spectre of what was once a religious festival, channelled through the cultural fabric of yearly seasonal festivities and commodified as the metric shit heap of christmas specific tack and ciche merchandise that sits in an attic for 364 days a year.

Along with this is the consistent drive, in main part by the increasingly aggressive marketing, to buy as much as possible in some post modern expression of materialist worship, as we express what was once our genuine focus on interpersonal appreciation and common good will, by seeing how much stuff we can give to other people.

This cultural modus is kept alive like all other religious ideologies, through fable, and characters of fable. Well known to be most effective if indoctrination begins as young as possible.

So we tell children about santa claus. We do it because its what's done at this time of year in this part of the world. People do the things that other people do because we're social creatures, then through that, the vast corporate interests at the fulcrum of our materialist paradigm get to vicariously feed in to, and off of, our collective desire to fit in.",Tiger_Widow,9,2020-10-19 12:02:28

NoStupidQuestions,Why is Tom Cruise never asked about Scientology and how has he survived this long without being cancelled? ,1eqabzn,lhqcgi0,"Tom Cruise is really popular in Hollywood for a few reasons.

1- He's a long-time movie star, he's good looking, and he knows the business

2- For a long time he worked on percentages instead of negotiating a salary. This made him a big ""get"" since he's one of Hollywood's biggest stars, but they can potentially get him for a project they wouldn't be able to afford him in. In return, since his own pay is based on how well the movie does, he'll go all out when it comes to promotion.

For this reason even though a lot of people find him annoying, it meant for a long time he could pretty much get any role he wanted. The flipside is that he has a tendency to take a little too much control, most famously in The Mummy to the extent that he essentially usurped the director, oversaw editing, and even brought in someone to do rewrites and give his character more screentime.

With that level of popularity and influence a lot of people are willing to give him a free pass to an extent. They don't question his more unsavoury qualities or actions.

It's also worth considering Scientology itself. It's been  accused of or proven guilty of a lot of unsavoury and outright illegal actions (like Operation Snow White), but it's also incredibly litigious. It's why every TV show, game, movie, book etc. that wants to make a point about it will usually create a fake religion or group (Unitology, NutriBoom, Practicology, Reasonablism, Reformed Neo-Buddhism, Spaceology, and Cosmetology to name just a few.) It's why in Bojack Horseman when Bojack talks about how he learned about cults when he was a scientologist... because he happened to read a book on them and Scientology is absolutely not a cult.

If someone says anything critical of Scientology, or even risks pissing off Tom (who's essentially the face of the religion) they open themselves up to lawsuits, however frivolous, and regardless of whether they have a shot of winning a lot of stations and outlets don't want a drawn-out legal battle because an interviewer offended Tom Cruise, and a lot of interviewers probably want to avoid getting fired for pissing him off.",video-kid,583,2024-08-12 11:51:04

NoStupidQuestions,Why is Tom Cruise never asked about Scientology and how has he survived this long without being cancelled? ,1eqabzn,lhr1r1c,"Cancel culture isn't really a thing in the way you think. Louis CK still sells out shows on his tours, tons of rock stars have admitted to sex with minors and they carry on without issue. Most of the talk of people being ""cancelled"" is coming from people with a victim complex who believe that people are coming out to get them for their political beliefs or whatever. 

Yes, some people become insufferable and difficult to deal with. So they stop getting more mainstream gigs. But plenty of them go on to make a huge living (bigger than you or I) while claiming to have been cancelled. 

Tom Cruise had a brief period where he was talking about his Scientology. It did not go well for him. He looked like a fool and was widely mocked for those beliefs at the time. Since then he's shut up about it, and presumably he won't take any interviews where they will ask about it. Keeping it out of the news this way has helped his career significantly as people forget about it.

The reason he still gets good paying gigs is mostly because of this. He's kept himself out of the tabloids in a negative way for a while. By all accounts he's great to work with, and a positive force on set. He's a great actor, and basically the only bankable movie star we have left. Everybody still wants to work with him because he brings a presence and a charisma to the production, and will get butts in seats at the theater. 

Lots of major actors have shady family drama. But as long as this doesn't become a liability to the productions they are working on, they will continue to get work.",AliasHandler,80,2024-08-12 14:36:38

2) The outright cost of a horse, carriage and stable is going to be as much as some cars. Upkeep, particularly vet bills, for the horse is going to dwarf the cost of gas.

NoStupidQuestions,If gas got too high and electric cars are expensive what’s stopping me from using a horse and carriage?,taysid,i0436pg,"I am a horse owner, so let me give you a realistic idea of what it costs: 

Horse that is trained enough not to kill you: $5000-$50,000
Feed per a month: $500+ depending on where you live, what dietary needs it has, increased water bill (and they drink a lot of water)
Boarding: $300-$1000 a month. How are you going to get there? Now you're looking at a barn and acreage to keep it at home. $$$ Now you need a small tractor, dumpster for all the feed bags and manure, fencing (which will put you back $5000 alone for a 100' by 100' space)
Hay: $12-$15 a bale. 1 bale lasts about 2 days. 
Farrier: $70-$170 every six weeks. 
Vet: hope it doesn't get sick or hurt. $100 minimum if you call out a vet.
Insurance (yep.): $400 a year for basic. 
Harness:$1200
Carriage: $10,000 (I've seen them for less.. rarely)
Don't want to deal with hooking them up?:
Saddle: $2000 that is good quality. 
Headstall/bit: $100 or more
Needs a bit of refresh on its training: $900 per month (most places are a minimum of 30 days). 
Enjoyment you'll get out of having a horse: priceless. 

Not to get too deep here, but our costs are increasing too. Fuel goes up, hay prices go up. 

Long story short, buy the BMW. You'll save money.",laurellivid,239,2022-03-10 15:02:03

Horses are ludicrously expensive to keep, however.  Not just in money, but in time & space as well.  They're not like your car that sits unused & untouched in the garage all week if you don't use it, and is ready to go at an instant's notice when you need it.

Your carriage has to be very specifically made, also.  I don't know all the regulations but I'm sure they pertain to size, weight capacity, & markings.  Note that turn signals are optional.  Oh, and the whole arrangement doesn't work very well at night.  It's not like you can just mount a floodlight on top.  The horse is going to have its own ideas.  Or it'll just stumble & break a leg.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do people always ask where we go after death but no one ever asks where we were before we were born and had a conciousness?,i912jf,g1ckyuf,"This is a question attempting to logically extrapolate a human concern that was built on emotion.

The emotion is fear and the driver is death. Death, of course, is a natural fear to any living being. Evolution clearly believes that this is a worthy trait for genetic propagation. 

There is no fear driving the question of what happens before we are alive, so humans see it as a question of far less importance. Furthermore, with less emotional stakes involved, there is less drive to distort the answer.

I'm willing to bet that a higher percent of people are willing to give a scientific answer to ""what happens before you're born"" vs ""what happens after you die"".

Of course, the answer to the former is:

""The delicate balance of systems necessary to generate your specific consciousness have yet to be created, and so you don't exist.""

And the answer to the later is:

Without wondering what's before or after (our personal experience, if we could be there to witness it), I'm interested in the thing from another point of view - how is life created? Cells grow exponentially and the physical aspect of creatures growing is obvious, but what exactly brings the life into the chunks of meat that we animals are?

Death is a lot easier to grasp. There is life, which then ceases to exist, nothing is forever, yada yada. But new life? Like I said, the physical aspect is easy, we transform and utilize various resources (such as energy) to create the shell, but where does the consciousness come from?

It sure is possible that our consciousness is literally just a fine tuned mixture of electricity and genetic programming (which is supported by the theories that there's no free will, all our impulses etc are hard coded into our dna). Who knows, maybe we really are just biological computers and creating life is just putting some electricity into that computer to get the 1s and 0s flowing.

If there are theological arguments for existing before you were born, they don't really matter to people because we can't relate to that stuff. You have no drive to believe in life before conception. 

But after existing for 70 or 80 years, after acquiring all sorts of experience and memories and connections that you desperately don't want to lose, the thought of having to lose it all forever and go back to not existing is just too hard to bear. So there's a strong drive to believe in a life after death that somehow preserves all the good things about living and removes all the bad things about living. And, of course, there's a strong drive to believe in a life after death that punishes those who deserve punishment and rewards those who deserve reward.

*That's* why people always ask where we go after death but no one\* ever asks where we were before we were born and had a consciousness.

While just as mysterious, I do believe that the reason (or atleast one of them) pre-life is not as talked about as often as the after life is because there is nothing to gain from knowing such info, it is something we technically already experienced. Unlike ""beforelife"", death, or the after life,  is an imminent event that all living beings (with some exceptions) have to go through. 

&#x200B;

Another reason may just be the fact that most religions have already established where or what you were before death. Religions such as buddhism have a cycle of life in which you are reincarnated. Others, such as Christianity believe that all humans have a soul which came from nothing. (Think Genesis 3:19:  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.// Which was the olden way of saying 'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust)  


At the end of the day, just like with the afterlife, nobody really knows. I, for one, wouldnt worry about it as finding a comfortable way of life is more important at the moment. And please dont take all this as an educated answer from a religious prophet or something. Im just a bored ass dude sitting in his room with nothing better to think of.",Shedeski,3,2020-08-13 17:59:36

The pre-mortal existence is different from the afterlife in that after we die, we go to the “spirit world” where we learn about Jesus and repent (if we didn’t have a chance to learn on earth). The spirit world is not Heaven. It is actually here on earth, all around us.

as for why they don't ask for before life

I don't even remember my first year on earth

I just know I was there


I don't know how to define consciousness

All I know is that I have the ability to know

Humans are not the only conscious creatures on earth

but we are the most intelligent creatures on earth as hard as that is to believe

And we are not Intelligent creatures up until we are born and after that a few months in we are still not yet intelligent

I think the next reason people don't ask as for where they were before they were born is that people know how reproduction works.

If I can make a guess I can be sure that I was in my mother's belly

and started out as a sperm and an egg to become a zygote...

Raising the minimum wage does put tremendous pressure on companies to raise prices. Take for example a company currently paying $7.50 for 500 employees. If each employee works 36 hours a week that would cost the company $135,000 a week or about $7 million a year. However if this wage was say $15 an hour the company would have to pay double that at 14 million. If the company doesn’t have those funds (a lot don’t) they will be forced to raise prices. Keep in mind these companies also have investors they’re trying to please. This creates more inflation and a continuing cycle of higher wages, higher prices. 

Now the government also has to worry about a couple other things, one of them is the fact that a lot of people put their savings into these companies, that includes 55 percent of adults in America which have investments in the stock market. If these companies have slimmer margins and or have to take on debt that could potentially destroy peoples life savings.

Every one will be better off but the people at the top not as much as trickle down.

My personal opinion, that I have long-contended is for the minimum wage to fall in a range based on company profit.

I'm also disgusted by how some millionaire company magnates are too cheap to pay living wages so their employees qualify for the taxpayer dole of gov assistance. In essence, they get us to subsidize their greed.

I’m in the Seattle area where our minimum wage was about $9.25 (give or take) and SeaTac and Seattle voted to make their minimum wage $15. Within a few months some businesses had to close because they couldn’t keep up or work out the new minimum wage with their profit margin. 

I’m all for increasing but I think doing it slowly instead of all at once would be a better way to go. Work out a schedule to increase it yearly and allow businesses to adjust and make the appropriate moves to maintain that pay grade.

And instead you incentive strong unions and let the unions and employers negotiate the minimum wage for each branch/company. 

It works quite well here in Sweden, for example a newly employed worker at McDonald's makes a minimum of $15/h between 0600-2000 weekdays and another $2,50/h after that or during weekends. A Big Mac costs roughly $4 at the moment. And for my two bedroom apartment in a medium city cost me $813 monthly including utilities, internet and parking.

The price of a good is determined first by the cost of human labor required to produce it, then by supply and demand.  

Although tying wages to internal inflation may ensure the purchasing power of locally produced goods, it puts the nation state economy at a disadvantage, because other countries that aren't doing that can produce the same good cheaper.  This is why the first job of all countries is to lower the standard of living of their inhabitants to ensure market competitiveness on the global market.

All seemingly egalitarian national policies are either designed to temporarily stave off unrest, more or less, or are the result of a temporary response to some extraordinary condition like economic collapse or war.

You arched yourself that put your head near you crotch. I’d venture to say if we all were self aware we do that every day: dropped my keys and bent over to pick it up.

As you get older you’ll find that one quick movement can throw out your back if you’re prone to it... if I was in your shoes I’d say I was messing around with weights and did a stiff leg deadlifts wrong.

NoStupidQuestions,What does it mean when someone works a “925”?,qoxlkz,hjq0o3l,"It’s “9-5” or “9 to 5” not “925” which means a job that keeps standard business hours in the USA, 9AM to 5PM.


Edit: Woke up to about 700 comments, no idea why this particular comment got so controversially popular. Let me address the most common - 

Yes, I have a job I’m a biologist. Thanks.

Yes, I specifically mentioned the USA. Imagine that. I’m American and I chose not to assume things about countries cultures I’m not certain of. If I had and I was wrong, I’d be getting shit about being a stupid American rather than ethnocentric (which is the correct terminology, not egocentric, you’re welcome come back any time for some assistance). No winning with you asshats. 



Yes I realize that strict 9-5 schedules are largely outdated. That was not the question, however. I did, however, answer the question. Which was “what is a 925”.

I, too, find the subreddit /r/boneappletea amusing. Hadn’t heard of the “Florida ceiling” one. Cracked me up. Thanks for that.

Edit:

I'll gladly pay for services that are proven to work (youtube red), I haven't found an ad blocker that works on multiple platforms that meets my criteria yet.


Benign advertising in a magazine or pamphlet is one thing, but 60 second ads on freaking youtube or full-screen spreads on allergy medicine on a website are cancerous. They make you wait to skip or design that fucking x so damn small that you ""accidentally"" click on the ad anyway, it's fucking disingenuous and crooked. They're grooming children to get used to buying shit they don't need so when they become adults it'll be second-nature.


Sure, ads make the company money, but maybe, just maybe, if your company *lives* off of ad revenue then maybe it shouldn't survive. Ads used to be about companies providing a service to solve a problem *and here's where to find us, etc.*, not anymore, now it's every youtube video (including first aid videos for fuck's sake), every shopping site, convenience app, etc. This is turning into *Idiocracy* levels of advertising. Brought to you by Carl's Junior...


I don't mind companies making profit in the same way that I don't mind fighters making money off uppercuts and roundhouse kicks, but at least with fighting you can't use weighted gloves, certain attacks, and there's a goddamned referee to determine what rules to follow and when enough is enough, these fuck's have free reign.",ogeytheterrible,4834,2021-03-30 19:53:41

NoStupidQuestions,Is there a name for the phenomena of intentionally avoiding a product because of how aggressively it’s advertised?,mgn56n,gsueobp,"There's *gotta* be a term of art for this.

There's just no way in hell the advertising industry isn't aware that once an advertisement reaches a certain level of ubiquity/obnoxiousness it starts driving potential customers away (e.g., I don't care if they're any good, I will never buy a pair of Raycons (ubiquity) and I would sooner drive my car off a cliff than donate it to ""Kars 4 Kids"" (obnoxiousness)). I'd be willing to bet there's been much ink spilled regarding how advertisers can get as close as possible to this threshold without crossing it. (I'm imagining a graph with advertising quantity on the x axis and advertising effectiveness on the y axis, the y value steadily increasing as x increases, and then all of a sudden dropping off a cliff).

Anyway, I do the exact same thing. I like to think of myself as a relatively informed consumer, but I'll still catch myself, before I do my research, kinda knee-jerk ""defaulting"" to a brand I've seen in advertisements (say what you will about marketing fucks, the shit works)... but if I feel like I've been ""bombarded"" with your ads, I will go out of my way to avoid your product.

Similarly, if you send me one of those ""we noticed you were browsing this particular item on our site for 10 seconds, you should come back and buy it"" emails (looking at you Home Depot), fuck you very much. Does anybody know what these are called (I'm not talking about abandoned cart emails)? What kind of inbred sociopath ever thought those were a good idea?

Here's a slightly edited version of an except from my undergrad dissertation. I apologise for the shitiness of my writing, English is my first language, I'm just a moron.

TLD at the bottom.

When you have an over-abundance of advertising bombarding the consumer, much of the content is filtered out or resisted (Rumbo, 2002). Academics have offered a variety of reasons for the phenomenon, and so they require an analysis to determine relevance to online media. Mangleberg & Bristol (1998) posit the socialisation model and that advertising resistance is learned through peer influence and parents. Ha (1996) offers three dimensions of advertising clutter that affect resistance that all require individual analysis: quantity, competitiveness and intrusiveness.

Quantity has been researched extensively by many academics over the past few decades, the vast majority of studies come to the same conclusion: that in the modern age of advertising, consumers are increasingly bombarded with an overabundance of advertising material. So much in fact that consumers are simply not able to process all of it, thus leading to much material being subconsciously filtered out. Also known as overload theory; the effects of the sheer volume of advertising messages directed at consumers has been debated by many academics (Malhotra et al, 1982) (Edmunds & Morris, 2000) (Eppler & Mengis, 2004) (Lee & Lee, 2004). Most agree that an increase in information available leads to better choices, however there has also been some evidence to suggest that an increase in brands may lead to poorer choices. The latter has been further augmented with parallel studies into consumer attention. Known as selective attention theory, Smith & Buchholz (1991) suggest that consumers have limited mental capacity to expend on focussing attention and so will not pay attention to advertisements as they are not seen as relevant, thus, should adverts wish to gain consumer focus, they must stand out as more relevant or important than other adverts. The nature of quantity therefore is somewhat paradoxical for the consumer. The more your own advert is shown, the increased likelihood of consumer attention and therefore retention, however the more adverts trying to achieve this, the harder it is to stand out resulting in less retention. This was later complemented by Ha & McCann, (2008) who demonstrated that increased quantity of adverts leads to consumers forgetting a higher percentage of adverts (recall/retention) and the poorer attitude of consumers towards the media platform. (Riebe & Dawes, 2006).

Since the advent and subsequent exponential uptake of the internet intrusiveness has also been studied in greater detail (Li et al, 2002) (Cho & Cheon, 2004). Li et al defined intrusiveness thus:

Intrusiveness is a perception or psychological consequence that occurs when an audience's cognitive processes are interrupted. Therefore, ads within programming or editorial units are not themselves intrusive, but rather, the ads must be perceived as interrupting the goals of the viewers to be considered intrusive.

They also found that intrusiveness led to irritation and negative feelings towards the advertisement. This could indicate that the advertisement was not processed by consumers cognitively and that consumers indulge in ad-voidance behaviours as described by Elliot and Speck (1998).

Competitiveness was defined by Ha & McCann (2008) as the degree of similarity between advertised products and advertising messages in a pod or group. Competitiveness does not appear to have been taken up by the academic world in the same way as quantity and intrusiveness, however it does have some basis within perceptual grouping theory (Pomerantz 1981), where items that are perceived to be similar are grouped together subconsciously and no single item stand outs to the consumer. For example, if you have a magazine with many adverts for watches then it is unlikely you will remember a single watch brand, however if you have a magazine with a single watch advert, a single jeans advert and a single suit advert you are more likely to remember each individual brand.

Tl:dryeah, advertising resistance has been heavily studied by academia. Deliberately avoiding a specific advert is known as ad-voidance, we do it subconsciously primarily because adverts intrude on what we were doing, however we can also do it consciously because a particular advert has annoyed us.  


Edit: dunno about anyone else but the term ad-voidance amuses me. So Punny",Themunchiekid,18,2021-03-30 22:16:19

They made it so that only one gender bathroom is open at each location (We have like 6 different bathrooms of varying quality around the school). My school is structured so that the math and science classrooms are one one side of campus and the english and history classrooms are one the other side with everything else in between. If you're a girl on the english and history side of campus, you might have to walk all the way to the math and science side of campus to use the restroom and vice versa. It also changes every day. I'm guessing this is so they can more easily monitor the restrooms without having to make everyone find a security person or janitor to open the restroom for them, but really all it does is make us walk more.

I hate this stupid trend of kids going around and fucking up all of the school facilities. 
3 classrooms were close for cleaning for 3 days after kids broke in and sprayed everything with a fire extinguisher (one of those was a computer lab/the robotics club which I'm a part of and I would have been so pissed if they had broken our robot). 
One teacher got all of her stuff stolen from her classroom (not just personal belongings but most of the stuff in her classroom) and she was completely destroyed since she was already having an extremely hard week.
the hand sanitizer dispensers in the classrooms are getting stolen and so are the water bottle refilling stations.

NoStupidQuestions,"Why do employers expect a 2 week notice when you're about to quit, but won't give you a 2 week notice when they're about to let you go?",a0vdit,eakoqti,"In most places in the US nothing requires you to give them 2 weeks. You may leave without even telling them you've quit. You will never be able to work there again though. 

And this is the difference. Employers who are firing you will never want you to work for them again, so they will lose nothing by simply walking you out the door. They don't care if you're upset at them. 

If you don't care about upsetting all of those people, go ahead and walk out. They'll never rehire you. If you go somewhere else and someone who you've upset by walking out is there, they may not hire you. 

If a company is forced to lay you off because of a business change or downturn and they do wish to rehire you, they will give you at least 2 weeks notice and keep on good terms with you so that if business makes it possible for them to rehire you they can. ",jet_heller,10900,2018-11-27 15:19:34

I liked the company and was leaving for school and wanted to go back so I actually gave a month notice. I knew they'd have to hire someone and train them.

They found someone internal to take over for me in a couple of days so I spent a lot of time at their desk training them. Well, Wednesday of the next week my manager called me into the office to say they were letting me go because I was never at my desk and I wasn't doing my work (a lie).

I filed unemployment. The company tried to fight it, saying I was let go for performance. However, a month before I had my annual review and had all high marks, and had never been in trouble.

Unemployment found on my favor and the company ended up having to pay me unemployment for 6 months. Instead of just paying me for two extra weeks, they fucked themselves.

The pool of employees is larger and less connected than the pool of employers.

On the flip side, itnis unlikely your employer can do too much to fuck up your life in 2 weeks between notice and you leaving. On the flip side, an angry employee with nothing to lose absolutely can fuck up a business if they want in 2 weeks. They can mess with files, piss off clients, sew discourd in the rest of the staff, etc. This makes offices more hesitant to give problem employees much warning.

That said i have been at plenty of jobs that did give notice when there was about to be layoffs, when a grant funded possition was ending, or when they knew of the firing in advance and had a good relationship with the employee.

Immediate firings were most often (though not exclusivelyl a thing when the employee did something wrong and they want them out the door now.

On the flip side, if a job royally screws you you are well within your rights to walk out the door. You won't get a good reference, but you may not have wanted one in that situation anyway.",bullevard,60,2018-11-27 14:59:26

Your system is rigged towards the employer and against the employee. The law doesn't give a shit about your immediate future, but wants the company to keep on flourishing.

In many countries in Europe, for example, its the other way around.

This is fine for a lot of stuff though. Like, their Shrek 2 DVD's aren't any worse than the ones at Best Buy. And sometimes you just need the cheap crappy tent or whatever. If you're just a city guy who decided to go camping for a weekend just for a change of pace, go get the crappy tent and pick up Shrek 2 on a crappy portable DVD player to watch while you're there.

But I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that women are told you need great hair and long eyelashes to be considered attractive. If you look at how many hair and eyelash products there are targeted at women than men they are completely outweighed. Plus there is a large amount of men who choose to shave their head so I guess it’s a lot more commonly accepted to see men with no hair whereas not many women shave their head. There are also other symptoms than hair loss with alopecia that you don’t get with baldness.

Men have insecurities about their looks but are much less likely to suffer professionally or socially if others perceive them as unattractive. Then there's the fact that baldness is largely associated with masculinity. And, aside from the social policing that demands women be ""attractive"" there's an added layer that prohibits them from being ""masculine.""

Nah yeah, not like people rip your hat off, call you bald, gross, ugly, and when you ask them to stop they just do it more.

In short: as someone whose been almost entirely bald for the past several years, Im gonna have to say it’s a double standard.

But, I think one big difference is 70% of men will lose their hair, and they expect and know about it their whole life, and have a pretty big support in the form of others around them who are also balding. 

Women do *not* expect to lose their hair, and it *is* tied to our self worth and idea of beauty. Women with shorter hair have been called some derogatory names implying they're less of a woman for not having hair, fueling the fear of being bald. Women have fewer options for support since most women are *not* losing their hair, and other women are not the safe space you might hope for. 

When a man is bald in public, he is bald in public. 
When a woman is bald in public, she is waiting to here, ""Hey! Someone pulled a Brittney...""

Special Re-Mentioning: I still don't think it's cool to be making jokes about these things. Those kinds of jokes can land and be guttsplitting comedy, but for the butt of the joke, it may be day one of their newly established insecurity.

It's not that the work is not interesting or I am personally not benefitting from it, just the motivation and urge to do stuff is gone.

The study that it was based off of asked student to time themselves and stop the timer as soon as they felt they were having trouble understanding the information. Basically as soon as you just can’t do the work or task anymore, take a 5 minute break. Go on Reddit or grab a snack or something. And then go back to it.

I do struggle to get something done for many reasons but there are days that I just stand in front of the laptop and go to the garden for a coffee and a cigarette many times.

I do not know if I actually feel guilty but certainly does not feel good to me because I do like the job I got but am not able to contribute as much as I know I could if this situation hasn’t occurred. 

Don’t beat yourself up! This is being hard for everyone and each one of us will find their weird way to cope with the situation!

Which should have been noted by my regular doctor but he didn't, so had to take the longer path)

Honestly, if you can, see a specialist to help you pin down the causes and give you proffesional advice and accompany you through making changes.

If not, try to see what is it you're trying to avoid by wasting time. Then break it down to 5 minute tasks. 
And try to do 5 minutes, something fun, then another 5 minutes.

1) there are literally more inhabited planets than there are active Jedi at their highest strength. Even during the Republic, 99% of citizens never saw a Jedi in person, and 99.99999% of those same citizens never saw the Jedi use any powers. The average citizen of the Republic was probably pretty skeptical of the Jedi actually having powers, and instead suspected that they were just leaning on legends of their powers to conduct their diplomatic missions. Sure, maybe the Jedi had powers long ago, but these days you're pretty skeptical of the whole thing.

2) the Empire, which controls virtually all interplanetary communications through the Holo-net, set about eradicating every record of the Jedi's power and influence. Where they couldn't erase stuff, they set about gas lighting the population about the corruption and fraud that was rife in the Jedi order, to the point that most people would believe that the Jedi had been tricking the Republic before Palpatine came along to save it.

3) anyone that had concrete info about the Jedi knew to keep their heads down and play along, or risk attracting the attention of the Empire and Vader's efforts to eradicate the remaining Jedi.

He pretty much made it up as he went along, occasionally accepting creative input from others until his head got too big.

Obi-Wan states that the Jedi were the guardians of the Republic for more than a thousand generations, but a few characters make it obvious that Force users/worshippers were generally viewed with skepticism at best. Han Solo, who would have been alive during the supposed purge (albeit only ten or fifteen at the oldest), initially thought it was a bunch of superstitious mumbo-jumbo, and despite Vader's obvious power, many in the Empire wrote off the Force as an old, dying religion.

I think it's more likely that the Jedi (and the Sith) would have lived quiet, monastic lifestyles dedicated to studying their own beliefs, similar to Catholic and Buddhist monks. They would have been viewed as secretive, perhaps even cultish, by outsiders, coming forth only as needed. Conspirators would have viewed them as having an unhealthy influence on the government, much like conspiracy theorists today view groups like the Freemasons with suspicion.

Consequently, after Palpatine became the Chancellor, he wouldn't have simply walked in and said, ""Hey, dudes, I'm the Emperor,"" but he would have gone total Nazi-style and focused on magnifying and spreading a strong anti-Jedi sentiment among the population, radicalizing his supporters, and declaring himself the Emperor only after gaining enough influence to guarantee he could defend such a position.",geekusprimus,615,2020-11-23 05:20:24

Well the galaxy is VERY big. VERY VERY big. Most of the time the story is only focusing on the few Jedi characters and it seems like everyone knows who the Jedi are. But no, there are only 10k Jedis even during their prime. Even though they fought in the Clone Wars, many parts of the galaxy (especially the Outer Rim) are not reached by the core worlds. There are also not that many force users. Most are just normal civilians. After Order 66, almost the entire Jedi order was wiped out. Jedi and Sith thus become myths to more people.

As I wrote this I wondered exactly this question, along with coming to also wonder why there weren't Jedi Temples all around the Galaxy.  

[I was a huge Star Wars fan as a child, but have lost interest since the prequels.  If i'm mistaken or off, this is not from someone with a great deal of knowledge outside the movies.  It was just a fun thing to do to occupy my time.]

In my brief attempt to write, I tried to explain why the Jedi were forgotten in exchanges with Bail Organa to both Qi'ra and Young Leia.  Remember, this is all just my concept, and has no standing as fact:

Bail explains at different points that the Emperor immediately began to erase or change history from record, much like how in Episode II a planet is removed from the archives.  Palpatine's Empire destroys and disrupts any and all history of Jedi and political enemies.  Purging this prevents opportunity to look to opponents of his.  With galactic control, he is able to make it illegal to spread false information, with harsh penalties, and things like video, images, text and relics are all removed and destroyed from both physical and virtual catalogs.

Remember in Episode I, how some Jedi treated the Sith as extinct, forgotten?  So much so that they actually didn't believe Qui-Gon's story about a Sith attacker on Tattooine.  This would be the same trend after the years of Palpatine's power and misinformation.  

But this is also done for more than just the overt reason of hiding the history of the enemy of the Sith.  Palpatine also would eliminate any history of Anakin Skywalker.  All of it.

By doing so, the Emperor hoped to push his puppet further into only being Darth Vader, manipulating him into having no human identity or past.  Palpatine would also truly eliminate the history of Padme Amidala as well, which would explain why Leia knew next to nothing about her (only what Bail would later tell her).  [This would sort of serve as a nice way to 'clean' the series, explaining why Leia had vague understanding of her mother, since all records of her mother's existence were being removed and any of it would be illegal to possess, especially for someone as prominent as Bail Organa or family.]

Removing all the contacts of Anakin's past means that even Vader cannot reflect on what he was.  In the moments of solitude he would have horrific flashbacks to a past he could not truly confirm, driving him deeper to anger and insanity, exactly where the Emperor needed him.  [This would explain why he almost feels an excitement when he senses Obi-Wan on the Death Star, as this would serve as some sort of proof that Anakin Skywalker's distorted past did exist in some way. 
 With the Jedi history purged and discredited, even Anakin was unaware what was truth.]

This idea was based around a few references, but a big one was how people in certain religions or countries are not allowed to use the internet like other people are.  It's filtered, and designed to keep out information that could change opinion or spark debate.  

It sounds impossible to think that in a few years people could forget something so prominent as a war or the people in it, but without any way to confirm memory, who could be certain.  Young people would grow up doubting the myths, older people would censor themselves out of fear.  

If you look at the modern world, it has access to the vast internet, yet people have such conflicting information or disinformation.  When you consider it, Palpatine being able to either hide or distort an entire group isn't too impossible.  He would gain further political strength as well, as those who brought up such 'fake history' could be labeled as fools, or worse...

It's a very neat question, as the idea of an internet clearly was not a concept in the original trilogy's time, and even in the prequel trilogy the internet still hadn't fully become what it is now.  But if someone edited all Wikipedia pages to remove or discredit certain people, and Wikipedia was the only source for all, or just enough of the population, I do believe you can manipulate people into forgetting a past and believing a manufactured past.  It fits really well with the actions of a Sith.",AnEbbtide,2,2020-11-28 07:40:49

The real answer is probably bad writing. A New Hope was the first movie written, and its two sequels were written after it blew up. The Prequel Trilogy was written years after the fact, and details like Han's description of the Jedi were glossed over for rule of cool. Thus you have Han calling the Jedi a ""hokey religion"" when he's probably old enough to still have heard stories of the Jedi's powers: based on Luke's age.

* Empathy.  We identify more strongly with each other, and don't want to see ourselves in that position or making that decision.
* The Slippery Slope.  Once it's legal to kill a helpless person, it's possible to generate circumstances in which you can claim that someone was helpless, dying, and consenting even if they weren't.  Sure, it may not be easy or likely, but as long as you have to fight to the bitter end for every human life, this sort of murder cover-up isn't really possible.  A mysterious death of someone on life support is still suspicious if there aren't medical reasons for it.  Not to mention that, given a few decades and evolving economic conditions, and next thing you know you're euthanizing the disabled *without* their consent...
* Humans are more valuable resources than animals.  Sad to say but true.  Civilization runs on human productivity.  Even an elderly, terminally ill invalid is a resource... to the hospital billing someone for their care if nothing else, economically speaking.
* Consent is a tricky issue at the best of times.  In matters of life and death, whether someone is of sound mind to consent to such an action is very difficult to nail down, legally speaking.  The likelihood of significant legal ramifications becomes too high.  Someone's going to disagree and file suit, and your defense - that they consented - is difficult to mount.

Besides, there are countries in the world that have overcome these issues and made consensual euthenasia legal.  I think they're in the minority, but still.",Or0b0ur0s,42,2020-08-11 12:43:15

NoStupidQuestions,"Why is it okay to put down sick animals so they don't suffer, but we can't do the same to humans even with their consent?",i7p2cs,g14izxq,"In the Netherlands it’s legal BUT there are some rules to it. Children under 18 are only allowed when there is unbearable suffering and no hope for improvement. We had to go through the process with my sister when she had been deadly ill for 7 months at the age of 10-11 ( and the doctors would not listen to us, she had a tube from the stomach through which she was fed but her body had rejected it and all kinds of nasty tissues and inflammations had developed, when we had permission and the documents for euthanasia however they did listen and removed the tube expecting it not to be true but instead of a 1 hour ‘inspection’ surgery to see her stomach they did a 5 - 6 hour one to remove the tube and tissue ). 
And we were starting it last year when she had fallen terribly ill but were sadly too late. ( she suffocated before we were able to start the treatment and procedures ) 

Either the person has to be suffering terribly and be terribly ill and not get any better. ( prospect of dying a horrible and/or painfull death )
Or they have to be an adult and make clear why they no longer want to live. ( terrible future health wise , bad health, very old with a bad health, cancer etc. ) 
You have to be able to talk to the doctors and tell them you wish to die. There is a whole procedure and you have to be found to be right of mind and in your right to ask it. ( when you suffer dementia or other conditions that may cause you to not be able to speak or not be right of mind you probably will not be able to have euthanasia) 

The debate about euthanasia is still ongoing though, just like the one about abortion. I think it’s terrible we’re more compassionate towards our animals than our own. The debate here, and the reason why it’s still difficult to go through is because of religious reasons...
There is a huge group of christians, catholics and the likes who are against euthanasia because they believe their faith sees it as suïcide or murder and you need to trust their sky spirit to determine when you die. Wether that be in a horrible way or not, you need to die from ‘natural’ causes the way their faith intends you to. The only other debate point is age, are old people who’ve had a fulfilling life and don’t want to die from bad health allowed to do so? Even when they’re healthy now? What about people we can’t help and ‘fix’ and who in the end will do it themselves anyway? 
But the biggest part is still the religions their belief it isn’t allowed. I know of two people who made the choice. Both young ( 34 and 50+ ) and both with an outlook of a horrible death. The youngest was ‘helped’ at the hospital and would’ve suffocated. The older one had cancer for a second time, no prospects of it going away and a terrible health. They’ve would’ve deteriorated untill there was nothing left with a hell of a lot of pain. Their GP helped and arranged everything with them. 

If we could’ve had the choice my sister would’ve had euthanasia too. It was what we preffered instead of suffocating with my father there helpless next to her. But sadly her body couldn’t put up with it any longer. She died 15 minutes before they would have the conversation with her doctors and start treament. 

On the other hand there is something you do need to realise. In many cases, like ours, if the patient can’t speak any longer and the family needs to step in to decide. It’s a lot harder to decide. I’ve had to put down three guinea pigs and our family dog. All at a point there was no hope and their health was in such a bad shape it was the kindest thing to do. But those decisions are already hard as hell. The feeling afterwards: ‘did they want it?’ and ‘was it right to do?’ Are allready there with them. Let alone you need to decide over or with a family member, a human being. Yes, you don’t want them to suffer and you don’t want them to die a horrible death. But you still live with a feeling of: but is there no hope? No hope at all? And you need the right doctors and specialist around you to make that decision. You cannot turn it back. And you will need to live with it. But in my personal opinion it is the last kindness we can show someone. Wether they suffer physically or mentally and will never be able to live a good life and have a fulfilling life with quality of life, they should be able to decide to leave however they want. 

We’ve always had the state of mind that we would make the decision when time came. And her quality of life would be the measure by which we would decide. In the end we were too late, after 4 days of fighting for her life, no progress and her body getting tired. Seeing her deteriorate with no hope of a ( descent ) recovery. We knew what had to be done. And I would like my other family members to have the choice when time comes. I have a younger brother who is also disabled. We’ve got a DNR for him as well and the same principle. When his quality of life might make life unbearable we would decide the same. It’s a hard subject to talk about. But very important. Ans i think it should be a basic human right. We have no choice over where, when and how we are born. At least let us decide when enough is enough.",DMeloDY,12,2020-08-11 18:11:37

NoStupidQuestions,"Why is it okay to put down sick animals so they don't suffer, but we can't do the same to humans even with their consent?",i7p2cs,g13nge4,"Euthanasia is legal in some places but let's talk about why it's generally controversial even if that's the case.

Simply, animals are not the equivalent of humans.

Animals don't have reason and they don't understand what's happening to them when they are in pain or when they have cancer. All they know is that they are hurting.

They don't have any ability to  reason about the value of life. The value of another day living.

I'm a dog lover and it had to put down many dogs but I will never put an animal on the same level as a human being such that humanity.

So when you've got say a dog that's in a lot of pain at  13 years old and needs chemo.. all the that dog is going to know is that it's suffering. It's not going to understand that it's life is being prolonged and it's not going to ascertain any value in that.

But human beings we do have reason. Some would say a ""soul"". We understand the value of another day seeing our loved ones. We understand and can reason regarding difficult things that are happening to us.

The taking of a human life for this reason is a far different. Human life is a sacred thing to most.

But let me point out a more practical and frankly more useful argument. If euthanasia is okay for people with let's say end-stage cancer.

That person may feel hopeless and they may not want to try any further treatments. The argument that we should allow them to make the decision they want to make with that hopelessness. Well first of all, deciding what is and isnt hopeless isnt always simple. But lets say it is.

But there are two primary problems. Number one somebody else has to do the euthanasia which means you are asking another human being to take a life. Or at least be complicit in providing the drugs that would take a life. Thats a huge moral question.

But also, by the same logic we should be allowing people who are suicidal to kill themselves. They also feel hopeless and they also don't want any further treatment and yet we don't let them kill themselves.

Or what about parents who feel that their child cancer is too far Advanced. Are we going to allow the parent to end their child's life?

You see in my opinion the problem with allowing euthanasia for certain extreme situations is that it is invariably and inevitably going to open the door for wider and wider reasons to do this.

So to sum it all up the two primary problems are that number one you are asking somebody else to be complicit in or to directly take your life. In other words you're asking somebody else to do the Dirty Work by providing the poison or doing the deed. And to many that is a violation of the sanctity of life in itself.

And allowing for certain situations where this happens can open the door for wider and wider allowances.

I understand that some people have very strong views on this and I certainly am willing to admit my bias in that I am not in favor of any form of medical euthanasia. I believe in the sanctity of life and that it should not be ours to decide to take, exception being the death penalty which is a completely different situation.",SaltySpitoonReg,6,2020-08-11 13:47:19

I think it's likely because it is perfectly legal to kill healthy animals against their will, so if you have a valid medical reason to do so it's even more accepted.

Now for people. The concern is a misuse. There are plenty of people that point to the terminally ill patient being barely alive who wants to die.  This is the same as the case for the death penalty use for a serial child molester and murderer. Neither case seems problematic.

But in the case of the death penalty, it quickly gets misused by prosecutors. In the case of euthenasia, will you see people guilt grandma into dying so that she doesn't spend any more of her estate? Would death save more money than a nursing home for an Alzheimer's patient?

I’m reminded that dreadful story in the news of an elderly Dutch woman who upon making remarks about wanting to die, the doctor had her coffee drugged with a sedative, and when she awoke during the euthanasia had to be restrained for it to be carried out despite her resistance. I can’t by any means speak for any particular patient or know what they’re going through, but someone wanting an escape from incredible discomfort or pain doesn’t guarantee they seriously are wanting a real mortal end.

Humans can derive good from suffering. They can make peace with their loved ones, and with their God, and with themselves. All time is precious, even time spent suffering. Not the same for animals.

There is also a difference between stopping treatment and intentional killing. A multitude of expensive treatments for an extra few days of life, in those kinds of cases for example stopping treatment doesn't really carry the guilt of murder.

 There was nothing more horrible to me than to see them suffer and not be able to do anything. In vet med, when we can't fix it, and we can't provide good quality of life, then we provide a peaceful and humane death so they don't have to suffer. It is an honor and a privilege to be able to help support my clients and to be there for my patients to prevent the kind of suffering I know they would go through otherwise.

1. Housing construction has not kept up with growing populations.

2. The houses, cars and vacations we take have gotten far more extravagant. The cars my father drove did not have air conditioning, power steering or automatic windows, for example.

It was normal to share a bedroom back then! People also ate out less, and there were far fewer options to deliver food or buy frozen food. You cooked your dinner from scratch. I did occasionally get pizza delivered growing up, but it was a rare treat. We are also paying for internet and phones - far more than we ever used to pay for a land line. Christmas presents were smaller. Birthday parties were at home. Behind the scenes I'm sure it looked like we had it all, but growing up it felt like I never had any luxuries.

My grandparents took vacations. Unpaid. Vacations were a trip to visit relatives. Stayed at their house. No hotel or a trip every 5 years to Reno. Never left the country. No cruises. Retirement for my grandpa was SS and a small pension. His total earnings his whole work life was less than $100k total. He retired in 1972 at 62. 

They had a house and 1 kid. Both worked. Never owned a car. Bought furniture once. Same plates, glassware, pots and pans, appliances my whole life. No fancy clothes. No extravagant spending. 

My parents struggled too. Yes they had a house and 2 crappy cars. Always in the shop. Vacations were trips to visit relatives. Long 3 day drives with 6 people in the car. If we went anywhere else, grandparents rode with us. 8 of us. 

Mom sewed clothes for certain things up until I was in 6th grade. They canned vegetables. Scrimped and saved. We never got fast food or get to go out to eat unless it was on vacation. Went to an amusement park and 6 of us split 1 sandwich and a drink. Christmas was 1 present each max of $20. We got 1 pair of shoes to last 1 year. We got clothes before school started and back up clothes at Christmas. You wore your old clothes in the summer. 1 coat each year. 

Mom started working when I was 12-13.  Prior to that her day was get us off to school and make lunches. Clean house and do laundry. Go grocery shopping. Make dinner from scratch and clean up. Everyday. No getting food or going out. My folks went out on date night maybe 1x per month. 

Everyone forever has struggled to get by. Your parents, your grandparents, their parents and grandparents. They struggled and worked hard. The good old days sucked. None were good and no one had the type of money you think.

What happened?",1hqh30j,m4phi1x,"Wow, some sus answers lol. There's lots of nuanced factors as to why but a big one that started it was wide availability of credit in the 1950s.where all of a sudden you didn't need to save for a car or a big purchase and then even bigger purchases could be financed over a longer period of time. Secondly was partly due to feminism where women wanted to get out of the house and work. This may have started as an empowerment thing but turned to a necessity by the late 70s to have two incomes. Backdropping this is the rise of the stock market and investing. Used to be that companies were parts of their community and would treat workers generously, but once publicly traded companies became a thing it was all about profit. Another big factor is globalization and the gutting of American manufacturing and good paying blue collar jobs. Basically governments sold us out to corps and the main benefit coming back to us is cheaper foreign goods. ",dub-fresh,8,2024-12-31 15:59:54

My best friend who was my also neighbor would always get my mom and grandma with a “punch buggy, no punch backs” whenever we would see a bug, as they were pretty common in the 1990s. After a couple years of these childhood antics, mom and grandma concocted a plan to exact their revenge. It started by then taking us to Chuck E. Cheese.  First they had us burn off our energy by giving us each a $10 roll of quarters for the games.They then got us doped up on pizza and soda. The second part of their plan was the most sinister. They gave us coloring books and markers for the drive home so we were thoroughly distracted. Then came the moment of revenge… all of a sudden my friend and I were jolted by a flurry of punches and a cacophony of women yelling every color imaginable… the pummeling only lasted a minute but the trauma left us reeling and in shock, unable to comprehend what had just happened. Turns out, they had used the ploy of taking us to Chuck E. Cheese and an innocent excuse to drive out of town… and one the way back stopped in a Volkswagen salvage yard that had hundreds of beetles. They revenge was perfect in its planning and execution. Such a beautiful thing when your mom and grandma conspire to such lengths to exact vengeance.  Haven’t thought about that one in a while.

NoStupidQuestions,Is USA as bad as it sound on Reddit ?,r9gjqw,hnbuyed,"Well, it's not too bad if you have a good job.

But coming from New Zealand, crimes are way more violent and around where I live, even in one of the most bougie cities (Bellevue, WA) there are shootings and murders at a scale I was completely unprepared for. 

Having that said, people are amazingly friendly, everybody throws out compliments constantly and seems like everyone want to start a conversation, even ones who holds literally racist views are at least courteous and friendly, funnily enough. 

Healthcare is completely nuts, if you don't have employer covering a good insurance plan it's very hard to feel secure, knowing a medical emergency could drain your savings. I also can't believe how much it is to deliver a baby, when it's practically free in NZ.

Higher education is very expensive, very easy to get into student loan debt spiral, as opposed to no interest student loans that we had back home.

Tax rate is good though, iirc it was about half (percentage wise) to what I paid in NZ. But if you tack on the extra costs for insurance and other government assistance, it works out to be about the same.

Gas and fun cars are so freaking cheap. Wide open roads make for great roadtrips.

The suburban lifestyle we see on TV or movies is actually pretty accurate. Two car garage, backyard, front lawn, home owner's association etc. Houses aren't cheap but it's at least affordable compared to Auckland.

So yea, if you are healthy and not poor, it's a great place to be. If you are not at least one of either, I'd recommend other developed countries.

Edit: so there's a bit of confusion on my comment about house buying, I lived in Bellevue for a couple of years (Crossroads, supposedly the ghetto part of the city) and moved south an hour's drive to buy a house. Not saying it's cheap, just compared to Auckland.",rangeDSP,7506,2021-12-05 15:00:36

There are terrible areas in the US but there are also areas in Canadas northern communities that don’t have clean drinking water.

Despite that, we still have gerrymandering in our states. We still have laws/ideals rooted in Christianity despite being a “secular” nation. We still have financially stable families going into debt because of one medical emergency. Higher education isn’t accessible for many people due to the cost.

It makes me laugh every time I see stuff like that. It's not even close to representing all Americans though. It represents rednecks a bit better, but still. I don't want to own a gun, I don't trust myself with the responsibility of owning one. Many, many other people I know also don't own guns and don't want to even though we all live in a state where I could literally just walk to a gun store and buy a gun today.

As far as shootings go I don't have numbers but I've always believed that it's the media blowing things out of proportion. There's a constant battle between one group wanting everyone to believe that guns are evil and should be banned completely and another group that wants everyone to believe that if everyone had a gun there would be less gun violence. So they're constantly trying to shove propaganda in your face to sway you one way or the other.

Healthcare here is absolute shit though. I hate the fact that I'm terrified that some day I might need real medical attention and get billed with a debt I'll never be able to repay. 

The work environment here sucks as well. I keep hearing about how other countries get months of vacation every year. The company I just started working for gave me 1 week when I was hired and will give me three to use next year and a lot of friends and family have told me they're jealous that I get that much that quickly. My uncle is about to die of brain cancer and apparently he's not close enough family for me to get a single day of berevement leave. Everyone seems to expect you to become a workaholic that takes all the overtime you can get and goes above and beyond for that tiny raise or maybe a promotion in 3 more years.

It takes a lot of effort to get kids to talk to each other in class. They walk in to the room from the passing period and continue to be on their phones. I can’t even say they are texting (talking to each other), but just mindlessly scrolling. Teaching has become exhausting for so many reasons, but the amount of effort teachers make to draw students out, talk, be present, and ask questions, engage in any meaningful way rivals staging a Broadway production.

What is going on?,18kg3e3,kdr3mey,"This is just my theory, but it seems to me that the internet has provided so much access to a diverse range of content and interests that common ground is harder to find.

When I was younger, we all watched the same tv shows and played the same games. Now there are tens of thousands of content creators, shows, games, and subcultures available to us that even if you meet someone who likes the same things as you in general, the chances of you sharing much common ground are slim.

I remember a time when playing games was something you could bond over, and the chances of overlap in games you'd played was high. Nowadays even if you both game, the chances are that one of you plays 5 different first person shooters while the other only plays farming sims. Maybe you both watch anime? Back in the 90s/2000s this basically meant watching Dragon Ball Z and Avatar TLA, or maybe Naruto. But now there's a good chance one of you only watches Shonen anime discussed by a particular YouTube channel, while the other exclusively watches anime from a particular studio. This of course applies to any number of things, from superficial interests like fashion, down to core philosophical beliefs. High schoolers are even discriminating against each other for having an Android phone instead of an iPhone and vice versa, or so I'm told.

The curse we're currently suffering from is one of overabundance and ease of access, which creates so much room for differences of opinion that it's harder to find common ground outside of those you developed your interests with in the first place.",ScruffyNuisance,3795,2023-12-17 13:57:28

Nobody hangs out at the mall anymore, and things like arcades don't really exist. Coffee shops are filled with remote workers using it as their personal work space, and bars and clubs play their music so loud that, even if I did meet somebody there, I couldn't spit the game I don't have anyway.

2) Online dating is a nightmare. If you're not extremely attractive, you're fighting a losing battle, and you can't fall back on having a great personality because the whole thing is extremely impersonal. And even if you are attractive, there are so many people that just use these apps for validation and don't actually have any intention of meeting up in real life. And even if you do somehow find someone that you vibe with and get them to agree to meet up, it's upsettingly normal these days, in all kinds of social contexts, for people to just not show up to an agreed upon meetup, and then act like they owe you no explanation for why they decided to both not show up and not tell you that they decided to not show up.

3) Millennials and gen z have been priced out of things that were normal adult milestones for previous generations. Most of my friend group in our late 20s and early 30s either never moved out of our parent's houses, or moved back in with them during the pandemic, and those of us that aren't living with our parents are either working multiple jobs or living with multiple roommates to afford it. None of those scenarios are particularly conducive to bringing a romantic interest home.

So unless you happen to be a reasonably attractive person, with a job that doesn't pay you dirt wages, and a friend whose girlfriend has a single friend that thinks you're cute, you're kind of SOL. And in the face of all of that, a lot of us are realizing that being single isn't so bad and in a lot of ways is less stressful, so we fill our time with hobbies and hanging out with our platonic friends.",ProbablyAnNSAPlant,283,2023-12-17 16:20:04

NoStupidQuestions,My 20 year old son doesn't date. His friends don't date. My friends kids don't date. What is going on?,18kg3e3,kdr9ew1,"There is no incentive for men to date women anymore. Previously, there were unspoken expectations; men would be given access to sex, sexual exclusivity, purity,  emotional support, and (hopefully) a lifelong partner. Women would be given physical and financial support, and (hopefully) a lifelong partner.

Today none of that is promised. 

Mens perspective: The average # of sexual partners skyrocketed (there goes sexual purity), there is no expectation of sexual exclusivity in many of the new ‘stages’ of dating and even if there is access to cheating has become significantly easier. You can’t expect emotional support because women are “not your therapist” and if you do share it will be used against you. The divorce rate is 50%, so why bother when there’s a 50/50 shot you’ll lose half your stuff and be forced to pay child and spousal support. And if she’s ever unhappy with you, she can replace you in seconds with the thousands of matches she has. And if you really want sex you can have a one night stand, fwb, or p*rn. Not to mention going on dates is more expensive and it’s still expected that the man pays for it, and if they don’t it’s held against them and possibly put on social media. Even approaching a woman is risky and could lead to harassment charges, job loss, and eternal public humiliation via social media. Ain’t worth it, rather play video games with the boys.

Women’s perspective: You don’t need a man for financial support because you can get a job. Why settle for one who has a physical, emotional, or financial problem when thousands of ‘better’ matches are waiting in your inbox? Why be sexually exclusive when you could have sex with thousands of more physically attractive people, and rich guys who are willing to fly you out to another city, drop Gucci on you and pay your rent? Why be pure when sexual promiscuity is celebrated and rewarded? After all, “ I don’t cook, I don’t clean, but let me tell you I got this ring”

This is why there is less dating amongst average people, and the rich and beautiful have more partners now than ever.",SendNudesCashCoke,75,2023-12-17 14:45:29

Your options are to go to a bar? But most people go with groups of friends if they go at all

You can online date, but most of those are just hook ups and at this point most women don't believe guys saying they want a real date even if they are. 

You can meet people in other online communities but there are a lot of worries that if it doesn't go well you lose your one social outlet because that space becomes awkward at best. 

The idea of teens hanging out at the mall, seeing a pretty girl and rizzing her up isn't a thing any more. It's a really sad thing and it's happening more in America than most other places because we don't have any walkability to our communities.

My dad never gave me guidance on what women like, how to be interesting or how not to be nervous in conversation and I think the same is true for many other guys. Hence the recent wave of terrible men’s advice all over social media. Young guys either get no advice or bad advice. 

The other reason I think is because going out is too expensive nowadays to do consistently. Even McDonald’s costs almost $30 if you’re buying a combo each for you and your date. If you’re supporting yourself you can only afford to go out a couple times a month. 

Long story short I think many guys don’t think it’s worth the time. Lack of knowledge and money, it’s easier to just hang out with the boys and play Fortnite (and I don’t blame them either, it’s what I did for a long time too).",None,60,2023-12-17 13:51:14

Feminism has spent the last 30 years condemning ""male sexual aggression"" without really defining it, and is now usually interpreted as ""male sexual advances"".  For young men it's just not worth the risk that their advance is seen as aggression.

NoStupidQuestions,My Brother is 13 and Illiterate,mrl59h,gundt6s,"I know a lot of folks are talking about CPS, but I wanted to throw in some advice on reading. I was an elementary reading teacher for many years. I also worked with older elementary kids who struggled with reading. The thing that got the fastest and most effective results for the kids I worked with was finding something they were really interested in and reading with them about it. For example, I had one kid who was a die-hard Trekkie. I bought him several books that went into the Star Trek lore and schematics of the ships and space stations. He would sit and pour over those for the hours with me and his parents told me he kept reading at home. I would help by reading aloud with him, sliding my finger under the words as I read - never telling him it was for his benefit. I let him think that's just how I read. Over the course of a few months, his reading improved significantly. I'm not going to tell you he was ready to read War and Peace, but he was able to get through basic texts with minimal assistance.

You're in a really tough spot and I applaud you for recognizing how important reading is and wanting to help your brother. Find something he loves, find a text on it (book, magazine, printed webpage - whatever) and tell him you want to show him something cool and just start reading, pointing as you go. Maybe find things regularly and do this. It can be five minutes or as long as you can keep him focused.  This absolutely won't solve everything, but it will help to bring him to a basic level of literacy and it might help him to become interested in reading.

Good luck and let us know how things go!

NoStupidQuestions,My Brother is 13 and Illiterate,mrl59h,gun1o0i,"Please know that getting CPS involved does not mean your family will be torn apart and you shouldn't feel guilty. When I was a kid we had a caseworker at one point and it was no big deal, he just stopped in a couple times to make sure no one was harming us and it was all over after a few weeks. 

As an adult, I had a mandatory reporter contact CPS because I had lost my home post-divorce and was living out of my car with my toddler. It was the scariest experience of my life, until I actually met the caseworker and she was super nice. She asked what my plan was and gave me advice on options I had. I moved into a new house with my son a couple weeks later and never saw her again. As a parent, it was a real splash of cold water in my face and really motivated me to take action and get my bearings as quickly as possible, and I'm actually grateful to have had the experience.

Only speaking anecdotally, unless your parents are actively abusing their children then it's highly unlikely that any serious action will be taken. Most likely, your parents will be spooked into getting your brother the support he needs.",maebeTrash,5456,2021-04-15 19:27:59

NoStupidQuestions,My Brother is 13 and Illiterate,mrl59h,gun9yol,"I agree with all the other posts regarding getting proper protective authorities involved, so I'll address this from the building literacy standpoint instead. 

First, make sure HE wants to learn. Motivation will be huge, and if he's motivated, his skills will grow much faster than if he sees reading as a burden.

Second, get him started memorizing sight words (super common words that are typically taught through memorization as opposed to phonics). The Dolch Sight Word lists are commonly used and easily Googled. 

Third, as he's building automaticity with sight words, look up ""high-interest, low-readability"" materials. Since teen and adult readers are typically turned off by reading books for children, these books are more accessible and feature more grown-up situations (while still being appropriately leveled for developing readers). 

Finally, consider reaching out to any local colleges (especially those that feature teacher preparation programs). Universities often feature low or no-cost tutoring programs, and even if this isn't something your parents would permit, you might be able to get in touch with someone to offer you even more targeted advice or access to materials.

That is what I came here to address. I have a learning disability too and it wasn’t diagnosed until *college*. OP, if your brother has health insurance, I’d recommend you take him to the doctor for an evaluation. My children went through those (it’s a four hour appointment where they test language, math, response times, puzzle-solving, etc)... Both of my kids have ADHD and 1 is autistic. Even though your brother isn’t in public school, knowing about any learning disabilities or difficulties can help him to access resources as he grows, and things like dyslexia can impact things other than reading! Also-You said he loves audiobooks, and he uses text to speech programs — that’s actually really great to hear! If he has a learning disability, his familiarity with these tools is going to help him a lot as he gets older. And if he *doesn’t* have a disability, you can use these things as motivation to help him want to learn to read. There are loads of books that aren’t available as audiobooks; you could try first bringing this up with him, & asking if he’s come across any that interest him... if he has, buy the book for him & then read it with him, combined with some practise of phonics. (This is how I practise Spanish: I buy books in Spanish and them read them aloud to myself. I keep a dictionary near myself while I read, to look up what I don’t understand. It’s slow going, but it makes the language stick, and keeps me interested.)  -Also, I don’t know if you have Dollar Generals (chain store) there in Texas, but here in Iowa, they offer adult literacy programs for the community. A couple of people also suggested the public library—these are also a good resource! Lastly, OP, thank you for wanting to help your brother.

I think that book would be really good for your situation as it sounds like you're willing to put in the time and effort. It was fun for me and for my mom to do together and I have always been grateful for that head start and I love reading now.

NoStupidQuestions,My Brother is 13 and Illiterate,mrl59h,gun57sm,"Years ago I worked as an aide in a high school in California that got students from lower schools that allowed kids to “learn what they wanted to learn” at their own pace, and would forward them on to the next grade regardless of what they had learned. It was the 1970s, when such ideas were not that unusual. Among my “learning disabled” (really just neglected) students was a senior who literally could not read at all. I taught him to recognize danger signs like “poison” etc. I asked him what his plans were after high school and he said he was going on welfare, like his parents. Another student could read just a little, and I created a one-on-one class to teach her with movies and very simple books. The “final exam” I gave her was to write her own name and address. Out of the whole high school population fewer than a dozen went on to college. I hope things changed after I left. Side note: This was the high school where some of the Green Day musicians went to school a few years later, in Crockett.

When he was electrocuted, his brain was overwhelmed by an electrical response from the power line that was much stronger than the body can emit to tell the brain it is feeling pain. Such a high voltage striking a person would disrupt these systems permanently, at least until he died. He was likely brain dead seconds after being electrocuted. Which means he felt no pain despite burning as he would have died from the electricity far before the fire killed him. People aren’t just saying it was instant to make you feel better, it really was.

She said she didnt feel anything at all. She was talking to her friends, and the next thing she knew she woke up in a hospital. 

Being that your brother passed, he probably took a stronger hit than her, but I would imagine that like her, he went unconscious before he even knew something was wrong.",Redditsfulloffags,21,2019-03-14 19:49:21

One thing to remember is that signals in the brain are carried electrically. We all have a small amount generated in our bodies, it's what allows synapses in our brain, signals from our eyes and skin and tastebuds, and even heartbeats to occur. And if something stops the normal flow of signals, the brain doesn't operate.

It's the current, the wattage, that determines the deadliness of an electric shock. [In the case of that power line, he'd have received dozens of Amps.](https://wattstoamps.com/12250-watts-to-amps) Death is possible at a fraction of an Amp (70mA, or 0.07A), a whole more likely between 1 and 5 Amps, and as a person approaches 10A it becomes nigh-on certain.

>""The damage caused by electric shock depends on the current flowing through the body -- 1 mA can be felt; 5 mA is painful. Above 15 mA, a person loses muscle control, and 70 mA can be fatal."" - Zitzewitz, Paul W., Neff, Robert F. Merrill Physics, Principles and Problems. New York: Glencoe McGraw-Hill, 1995.

How quick and merciful was it. So fast it struck before he had reaction time to notice. It wiped his mind before he saw anything, before he heard anything, before messages from his body could reach the brain. He was dead the instant the circuit was made between him and the equipment. His brain had no way of registering any pain. An odd way to look at it, but his end was as merciful as the situation was horrible. ",Jackpot777,17,2019-03-14 19:01:52

NoStupidQuestions,"My brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt?",b133jp,eijl9bc,"Couple things, I am a lineman and work with primary voltage daily. 

When contact occurs with equipment sitting on the ground (cranes, drills, pumps ect) the path will travel the shortest path to ground, which would be outriggers, anchors, even people if a person was in contact with the equipment and the ground at the same time. That is why we lineman wear dielectric boots, it essentially creates no path to ground through our feet. 
You stated your brother was standing on the equipment when it contacted the electric. If he had his whole body on the equipment even while the structure was electrified, he would be safe, for the time being. Think bird on a wire, or the guys that are getting out of a helicopter and jumping on live transmission voltage lines (69Kv+).  They are fine due to no difference of potential. 
If he tried to climb off the equipment while energized, that would create a difference of potential, and would essentially lose control of there body and go unconscious.

I work on live high voltage powerlines at the uk equivalent voltage (11,000V).

From farm workers driving tractors into the lines to people picking up downed powerlines. Unfortunately it is unlikely to have killed him instantly. That’s something that is surprisingly rare and I say that from experience and hours of safety investigation briefings. There’s far too many variables and far too much science to assume his cause of death but I can say without doubt that he would of not felt any pain at all.

You may not like to read this, he may not have died instantly. What kills or mames a lot of people is the fire. That being said the explosion that happens around a electrical arc usually knocks people out, I have heard it compared to a hand grenade going off right in front of you. The fire then kills you while your unconscious and unable to help yourself. Also high voltage AC electricity generally has so much power that if you get caught in between it and where it wants to go, it will blow the body apart and cook any living tissue in between. It also can cause your muscles to contract to the point of bones breaking. Hopefully the explosion knocked him out first. The only way to get some idea of what happened would be to know how far they found him from the drill rig.

**Breathe in before you sneeze.**

It may sound obvious. It may sound intuitive. But no one I've encountered has ever taken the time to explain why it's so important to have air in your lungs before you sneeze. So one day, I was telling a joke, and running out of breath, and felt a sneeze coming, and decided I could spend the last of my air on nailing the punchline then worry about the sneeze. Right as I had expelled the last of my breath, the sneeze decided it couldn't wait.

When you sneeze, your muscles try to quickly, forcefully constrict your lungs to push the air out of them. This happens even when there's no air to squeeze out. For me, that meant dislocating two rib heads. Since that day, about 15 years ago, I have had pain related to that injury, sometimes so bad I can't sleep.

Now, admittedly, I was a young adult and dumb, and trying not to cause a scene around my friends, so I didn't tend to the injury right away. As it worked out, I didn't actually get the ribs reset for almost 2 weeks, during which I moved from one state to another. All of that absolutely exacerbated my pain and contributed to why it became a lifelong injury. Treating injuries seriously is important, but people will tell you that part.

Please, don't make my mistake. Air is easy to get, put some in your lungs before you sneeze.

Edit: To save my inbox from months of the same question, **I don't remember the joke anymore**. It was a timing dependent joke, getting the punchline just right was part of the humor, which is why I prioritized the joke. Most likely it was a long-winded pun of some sort, as that's the kind of joke I'd tell a lot back then.",gameryamen,5080,2022-11-23 18:04:39

Yes, I’m sure you know plenty of people who have done it and are just fine. Don’t do it.

Never wrap a rope around your hand for grip. It’ll burn, for one, but if there’s a load on the other end it can knot around your fist if something goes awry. Fold the rope in your palm and hold it like that for grip. If it’s not enough, you probably need a snatch block or need to take a different approach.

A general rule of thumb for average people is “no dynamic movements” on unstable surfaces. Like, don’t jump from rock to rock in a stream or try to jump from or onto a moving surface. Slow and steady might not win the race but it’ll save your ass. 

The proper way to hold scissors when handling them but not using them is to hold the cutting end closed in your closed palm. Seriously, teach your kids this. 

Every material that says “proper ventilation” on it is serious. Open windows and set up a fan or use it outside or in an open garage. 

Don’t store oily/flammable rags in a pile. They can spontaneously light up. Neat YouTube videos on this one.

If you don’t know how to use a tool, don’t use it. From saws to forklifts, you’ll hurt yourself or someone else or cost yourself money.

What are some other examples of life-saving tips that a potentially uninformed person wouldn't be aware of?,z2u64j,ixjwugy,"1. Flour is flammable/combustible. If you accidentally drop a bag of flour and it poofs out everywhere, *DO NOT TURN ON A FIRE.* This is how you explode. 

2. The easiest way to stop an oil/grease fire in the kitchen is to starve it of air. Cover your pot or pan with its lid and that should do the job. 

3. Another method of choking out a fire is to throw **baking soda** on it. *DO NOT USE FLOUR OR YOU’LL GET A BIGGER FIRE*

4. Do not use a wet towel or wet oven mitt to hold hot things. It will burn you. 

5. If you are ice skating or even just walking on black ice, *BEND YOUR KNEES.* It will bring your center of gravity down and make you less likely to slip and fall.

6. Clean the lint out of your dryer. If you leave it too long, it’ll build up and potentially start a fire. 

7. If your pills say to take with a glass of water, try to avoid swallowing them dry or only taking a sip of water. Not only is water a vehicle that helps the medicine get to your stomach, it does other things such as help dilute it (if it’s strong), but also prevent throat irritation from swallowing without an adequate amount of water (aka do you want your medicine to start dissolving/fizzing in your throat where your saliva is? or do you want to prevent that by drinking enough water to wash the little bits of medicine down your gullet?)

8. If your medicine says to *take with food/a meal*. EAT A MEAL BEFOREHAND. Do not take that medicine on an empty stomach and chase it with your food. If your medicine includes this instruction, it’s likely that it needs the presence of something in your stomach to soften the irritation it could cause on an empty one. 

9. On a similar note, if your medicine says to take on an empty stomach, try not to eat until after ingesting the pill. Some medicines absorb better without food in your gut. 

10. Clockwise is to tighten, counter-clockwise is to loosen.

Edit: 

11. Wet a towel and put it next to the cutting board when chopping onions (paper or fabric it doesn’t matter). The vapor that causes tears from onions are attracted to water/moist things, which in most cases, the nearest moist environment would be your eyes.

Edit again: 

* Of course goggles work for chopping onions because you’re preventing the onion vapors from reaching your eyes. I just wanted to give a simpler solution with something you may already have in the kitchen, aka a hand towel. 

* Yes I know what righty-tighty lefty loosey is. But it’s not inherently obvious that it means [“turn right from the top” = tighten] when [“turning right on the bottom” = loosen] is a thing too. The phrase to remember how to open jars and bottles is to help children remember, but they can also easily confuse whether the direction means turning from the top or bottom. Saying clockwise and counterclockwise (from top view) breeds less misunderstandings.",GardenLeaves,509,2022-11-24 00:09:35

NoStupidQuestions,How is Will Smith allowed to stay in the venue where he just assualted someone on live TV.,tq1dl2,i2f8bys,"When the assault happened, the majority of the audience, both in person and through screens, believed the skit was staged. 

It wasn't until Will Smith yelled the word ""fucking"" (twice) that people started to understand it wasn't likely a skit.

By this point, the committees, publicists, and law enforcement were conversing to figure out the next course of action.

The Academy made the decision to allow the show to continue, but kept tight control on the security from that point forward. Rock wasn't anywhere on stage when Smith received his award. Then, of course, Smith gives his impromptu speech when he won the Oscar.

Regardless if the incident was staged or not, it has created a polarity in conversation regarding the Oscars given situations like this has happened before. Anything can happen when airing a live performance.

Most likely what will happen after this fallout is the committee will deem any jokes against any person are no longer allowed, and there will be an increased security to prevent anyone from just walking on stage.

The Oscars have been a joke for decades, but for some reason, people keep tuning in, like any of it truly matters.

If this action doesn't turn people off to this ridiculously phony ceremony, this says more about the audience than it does an upset comedian.",None,272,2022-03-28 10:46:08

Rock made a joke that didn't get big laughs, used a outdated reference and insulted someone over a medical condition. Hollywood isn't quite sure how to react yet without gauging public reaction. Careers besides Rock and Smith's are on the line and the best thing to do is wait a bit.

Imagine if Chris Rock made a joke about the Matrix director having their dick cut off and her husband walked up and slapped him. Trans discrimination is taken more seriously than female hair loss. However this may lead to female hair loss being taking much more seriously.

Tobacco is grown all over the US, often by private parties, it's a huge industry (including cottage industries like small-time pipe tobacco producers), etc. Enforcing a ban would be a nightmare.

2. The ""causes all sorts of cancer and diseases"" statement isn't quite as black-and-white as many people think. Without starting a flame war, it's safe to say that debate exists. Nicotine in itself may not be as harmful as once thought, frequency of smoking may play a huge role (one pipe a week != 2 packs of cigarrettes a day, etc), as well as additives in most tobacco products, etc. 

3. Tobacco's addiction is not at all the same, physiologically, as something like heroin.

Hell, I know a few people who straight up don't believe that cigarettes have any negative health benefits in spite of the fact that they're hacking up a lung every half an hour. And don't even get me started on dip. I've literally heard people say ""How can it hurt me if there's no smoke?"" Grandparents still talk about how they used to string up tobacco in the barn as if they were doing God's work.

There's just too many people who refuse to believe that tobacco is inherently harmful, most of the people who still smoke have been doing it since they were 12, and people won't believe that the farmland can be used for anything other than tobacco.

My dad was way ahead of the curve, taking CS classes when he was in high school (college classes in high school). He was advanced in both hardware and software. It was turning into a whole new world. He kind of dreamed at working for NASA, but settled running the entire server system and being the sole IT person for a plastic mold company that relies heavily on computers for the artists to make molds. He worked there I wanna say 20 years. He was let go during the 09 recession to have his work shifted to independent IT consulting, tbh I dont entirely blame them because he had alcoholism issues and diabetes, he was already walking on canes and had a few hospitalizations. The worse was yet to come, he threw himself into alcohol and lost his legs, developed alzheimers mixed w alcohol related brain function issues. This happened when I was 9.

This backstory is relevant, because even tho he was a tech genius and constantly building PCs for his friends, working on laptops, kept teaching himself, he didnt teach me anything but had hopes of building a color organ with me. That kit is still in the basement, 10 years later.

I am now the designated computer geek for my family. I built my PC, I do soft coding for minecraft and friend level minecraft servers, I can do basic troubleshooting and diagnostics. I taught myself damn near everything. I researched, I befriended dev's who taught me, I spent countless days working to better my tech savviness, which tbh isnt a whole lot but meets my gaming requirements.

My dad loves to say how HE taught me all that I know. He keeps going on and on about how well I know java and how he helped me with it, how I assembled my PC solely with him holding my hand thru the process, etc. It drives me nuts. Hes called me frantic before because some of the junk on his desk flipped his PSU switch and he couldnt figure out why his computer wasnt booting. I helped fix my mum's tower, his liquid cooling tower, his 2 side project towers for his friends, and he either takes the credit or takes credit for me learning from him.",JaysHoliday42420,25,2021-02-01 19:24:40

NoStupidQuestions,"Why do many Americans seemingly have a ""I'm not helping pay for your school/healthcare/welfare""-mindset?",o9i7ub,h3bll0k,"So what's interesting is that Americans overall tend to be very generous (statistically across the board vs other countries) in terms of donating money to causes or people.

1. But a lot of people have an issue with the government taking more of your money to ""do ___"".

For one a lot of people don't trust that the government is actually going to do what they say they're going to do. Anytime a bill comes up that proposes increased taxes there's always debates that allege that the money is actually not going to go towards what it says it's going to.

Ie - there was a recent bill in my state that was designed to raise taxes with the extra money going to the schools but the argument against it was that the increased taxes would just go to the already overpaid School administrators and not actually go to the classrooms.

2. Also America is the society that has individualism ingrained in it, but again Americans are generous so that doesn't tell the whole story.

3. Especially when it comes to government programs, a lot of people may feel that those types of programs are going to wind up being exploited by people who don't truly need it and are just going to mooch off of the system. And they don't want their money going towards that. They would rather to donate their money somewhere where they perceive that it's actually going to be useful.

That or they feel that the people who are going to benefit shouldn't be benefiting from it. For example people who feel that illegal immigrants should not be entitled to free healthcare.

-------

Overall, I don't find that the majority of people or a large majority of people don't want programs like State health Care in place, or money allocated to the schools etc. With more people it boils down to concerns about who's making the decision about how that money is distributed and how that money is actually going to be distributed and if they feel like that is antithetical to their political or worldview",SaltySpitoonReg,2783,2021-06-28 14:08:35

And those corporations are always fucking around taking more than their share too.

So people at the lower levels of this pyramid scheme that is the American economy feel entitled to take. Or to do things differently even, to have the means to live. This can really ruffle the feathers of those trying to maintain a standard of living they previously enjoyed with less effort.

Many Americans where I lived and the rural community held such contempt for the government for taxes,  for helping others. 

This community when I left had no hospitals within a 30 minute car drive. No doctors office. No school . No fire station . No police station . One sherrif office and a grocery store . And, terrible internet. So many businesses have closed , the hospital closed and sold off for apartments refab . The loss of the hospital ultimately means the slow death of the community, it is now fate 

The people who are mad at this loss are the same people who voted for the leaders who voted for the loss. The community I grew up with and the people in it 

Now when I visit as an older adult , I hear the same talk from them with new eyes and ears. 

Angry at the loss of government investment and their local community, angry that city people have this and that and they don’t, thinking everything is pointless because no matter how hard they try it will be completely lost and won’t move the needle for them

These people are desperate for reasons to find why their community and it’s future is crumbling and they all have been led to believe it’s other small people taking away too much of the rations , they are blind to the billionaires game of stuffing pockets and playing politics

To accept government assistance when you’re in a place of need is to succumb to a trial that is meant to strengthen you. Embracing your suffering means accepting god’s will, accepting betterment of oneself, and forging the temptation of an easy fix. The issue is that this idea hinges on the belief that hardship can always be overcome by willpower alone. 

My parents grew up in a time where a 40 hour work week could provide enough to buy a home, a car, new clothes for school, and some small things to celebrate birthdays and christmas. That’s impossible now, of course. But to convince them that willpower alone won’t ever be enough for some people to get to the point of property ownership, financial independence, or the ability to retire means confronting them with the reality that their iron will isn’t what got them through their own struggles.

i think the issue is that using tax money to subsidize these things has some bad side effects 

- federal aid for universities and guaranteed student loans send this signal that kinda writes a blank check to universities. they can increase their prices as much as they want and it'll be paid for either with tax money in the form of grants, loans. we don't really let universities just fail for being unaffordable. more tax for universities would seemingly cause them to bloat even more

- healthcare is in the same boat, kinda. price has lost all meaning. zillion bucks a pill doesnt matter because everyone de-facto has insurance that will ""negotiate"" it down to much less. the obama-era federal insurance mandate made this even worse - healthcare providers were basically written a blank check. again, we're not allowing unaffordable or unscrupulous healthcare institutions to fail for being bad; we prop them up with tax money
