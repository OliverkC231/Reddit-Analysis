They swapped billionare with bottom feeders, let the rich do the basical job, on the lowest salary, to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort. 

Nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere, regardless of how hard they worked, even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society.

There was only despair, and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense.

It stirred big debate among the society back then, and I think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled .

There was also another show in China, swapping senior political figures with community level council workers, to see how good they could do in each other's posts. The mayors were flooded by the angry mobs who kept asking for more and more benefits that were impossible to fullfil, by the end had to admit the amount of work at basic community level was too much to archieve anywhere.

I will brace for the down-votes, but I don't understand why we fault people for making a lot of money (as long as they do it honestly). The dark secret of any executive, athlete, artist, actor, etc. who makes an exceptional amount of money is that this is what the market will pay them. The CEO of company X likely has a skill set that is very useful for planning corporate strategy that few people have and that takes decades to develop (understanding of finance, ability to read market trends, skill negotiating partnerships and labor agreements). If they are good at this, the company and its shareholders (if they're publicly traded) will also benefit. So, this is in many ways an investment.

As for the workers who earn less, we should raise the minimum wage. But, they too are free to seek employment elsewhere if someone will pay them more money. It doesn't make sense getting angry at market dynamics.

If any company were to apply a policy overnight that ""we are going to pay our CEO the same as our assembly line workers, you would likely see that company go bankrupt soon as because the only people willing to do that job at that price, probably don't have the experience to do it wisely. All the qualified candidates took jobs at your competitor's factories where they were offered more. Same is true for basketball, or any other sport.

You think someone like Jeff Bezos, or Bill Gates, or Elon Musk couldn't handle it? Or what about Warren Buffet? The dude is already living a modest life.

A lot of dumbasses in the comments seem to fail to realize that a lot of these billionaires were already in a super shitty position before, and pulled themselves out of it.

I had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  

I remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. 

Or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves ""what I didn't hear you!"" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  

My time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.

We approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.

AskReddit,Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,9whgf4,e9koq5z,"I know it’s “silly” to mourn public figures who you never personally knew, and obviously my grief pales in comparison to the grief of his loved ones, but this one (and Iwata) really got to me.



I knew Stan Lee before I knew who the hell he was. He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn’t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I’m not powerless just because I was a kid. 



While it’s easy to write off comic books as a child’s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I’m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I’ve come to call “Peter Parker Syndrome.” So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. 



His is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.

Edit: since people were asking what “Peter Parker Syndrome” is, I’ll copy/paste my response here. It’s an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:


It’s how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. 


I started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the “disguise.” 


Anyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn’t care, because he gets to be the hero and that’s what matters most to him.


Time passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can’t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.


Then the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.

I then relate the client’s self care to their “Peter Parker” and their desire to be there and care for others to their “Spiderman,” to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.


A seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.",s0_Ca5H,213,2018-11-12 20:19:59

He is my hero, I didn’t have the most active male role models in my life and I used comics to fill that void. I learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone. I learnt all about racism at a young age through x-men and I learnt patriotism and to always fight the good fight through captain America. Of course I learnt weird things like don’t go through space portals or don’t inject yourself with a weird virus as your girlfriend tries to kill you. But most importantly I learnt there is others out there like me who also were alone and needed someone. I grew up when it was still lame to be a nerd and I was bullied for knowing what the circle in iron mans chest was. My first fist fight was over Spider-Man. My first memory of my dad is him reading me west coast avengers. 

To Stan lee, thank you. You helped me grow up and become a much better person then I would of become without you. I owe you so much and it hurts I couldn’t give you more than a smile when we met.

A few years ago I was going through a breakup from an abusive shitbag.

I lived next to a boat yard and one day went to jump from the dock. I can't swim. I didn't have the courage to jump. I just sat there crying. I realized I reached rock bottom. That week, my friend persuaded me to go see a movie with her. It was my first introduction to Marvel. I was hooked.

Stan made it a priority that most Marvel Super heroes also show a degree of vulnerability and also in many cases (X-Men, Spider-Man) show them doing the right thing and getting absolutely nothing out of it; Peter Parker would still be broke and mutants would still be persecuted against.

During the Q&A section of his panel, a young kid came up and said he was doing a presentation about Stan to his class about Stan’s work and life. And he asked for a video intro to the presentation. And Stan could have blown this kid off, but said said sure and the kid had a script and everything. And Stan did the video intro three times for the kid so he would have a good take and a few options.

We all sat in the audience silent as he did it as not to blow the takes too. And I thought, goddamn. Stan really cares about the fans.

AskReddit,Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,9whgf4,e9l8tzr,"Years ago, right after Disney bought Marvel, my wife and I were visiting a friend for lunch at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. 

Two years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value.

AskReddit,Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,9whgf4,e9kwan5,"I always loved superheroes, and my childhood was filled with Marvel. Spider-Man was always my favorite, because I was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating. I loved him more as I grew up, because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles. Quick with jokes to cover insecurities. A deep love of science that shaped everything I did. The implicit knowledge that I may not be the strongest, or the toughest, or the most resilient, but that I always had to stand back up. Intellectually gifted and, with it, a compulsory, driving need to use that to help people. It's why I became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses, and then later Alzheimer's disease, because I recognized that I had a gift - and so I had a responsibility.

Spider-Man is paper and ink, but he is an ideal I always have, and always will, aspire to. He is my hero. And the man who helped give me that ideal, who shaped so much of my childhood and identity, has died, and the world is a sadder place.

AskReddit,Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,9whgf4,e9kwl4n,"My first SD ComiCon, I ran into him kinda. He was being escorted outdoors, along the main glass hallway where all the talks were happening. It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, "" I LOVE YOU STAN!"".

I didn't expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, ""Love you too!"".
 
Many years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. 
Once our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn't hear me but it didn't matter. 

Out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. 

Stan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.

If it’s illegal because the noise “may cause confusion” then same thing. “Mimic’s emergency services” now means that only the government can put out warnings.

>xxx: [smack-my-bitch-up.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/smack-my-bitch-up.sh) \- sends a text message ""late at work"" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.  

>xxx: [kumar-asshole.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/kumar-asshole.sh) \- scans the inbox for emails from ""Kumar"" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like ""help"", ""trouble"", ""sorry"" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply ""no worries mate, be careful next time"".  

>xxx: [hangover.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/hangover.sh) \- another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like ""not feeling well/gonna work from home"" etc. Adds a random ""reason"" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.  

>xxx: (and the oscar goes to) [fucking-coffee.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/fucking-coffee.sh) \- this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew.

Every year in the Canadian winter, powerlines would fail due to the weight of the snow. It took many days to build up enough to break a line so they employed a team to walk the routes and shake the poles to loosen the snow.

One day they saw a bear shaking the poles and realized that if they could get the bear to do it they wouldn't need to walk the route.

So they gave one guy a bucket of honey and he'd walk the route painting the sides of the poles with honey to attract the bears. It worked for a few more years But this still takes a lot of time to do.

So then they had the idea of flying a helicopter along the route with a trained sniper with honey paintballs that he'd shoot the poles with.

On its maiden flight the helicopter passed the lines and the downdraft blew away all of the snow.

The flights continue to this day but without the sniper.

There was a manufacturing plant that made toothpaste. One year for some reason there ended up being an unusually high number of empty boxes being shipped out. So in order to stop that from happening the head of the company hired a couple engineers to develope a system to catch any empty boxes so they didn't get shipped with the boxes that actually had the toothpaste tubes in them.

The engineers developed a system that if the box weighed below a certain amount the system would stop and a worker would have to go remove the box and start everything up again. The person in charge loved the idea and implemented it immediately. And right from the get go the number of empty boxes shipped dropped to near zero. 

The head of the company wanted to go see the system in action so he goes and visits the plant one day and notices a huge fan right by the assembly line. Very confused as it wasn't hot he asked the plant manager why the fan was there. The plant manager said the workers were tired of stopping what they were doing to remove an empty box so they just hooked up a fan to blow the empty boxes off the scale before the system recognized it was empty and shut everything off.

So I made copies of the files, and made one for each template. I labeled everything, made it so the images on top of each other wouldn’t clip into the lower ones like the previous did.. so on.. you could be in and out of the template in 2-3 minutes.

I got fed-up with hand writing itemized sub-orders at work, so I set up a spreadsheet that you can just fill out. Then I got tired of having more than one program open, and not being able to search within & among those order sheets (at least not automatically, or easily), so I'm having our FileMaker guy integrate it into our greater ordering & invoicing system.

I was frustrated at the pointlessness of sorting a giant pile of paper invoices from an unpaid stack to a paid stack every month, so I just use the accounting software to keep track.

I became *so irritated* with having to fill out a multi-page, printed spreadsheet for every single order (sometimes just one item, two pages in [and frequently, there would be those pesky itemized sub orders]) that I condensed the items into ""most used"", put them  all on one easy to read sheet, and encouraged my co-worker to simply write out the more uncommon items at the bottom.

Basically, I hate busy work, and paper invariably leads to busy work. I have tried to reduce the use of paper in our office, but have not been entirely successful. 

We have to have written order forms available (because sometimes the orders are coming in too fast to be able to type it all quickly & correctly), and have to keep some paper records for things like Organic, FDA, and USDA audits - but all in all I'd say my absolute hatred of filing has reduced busywork here by at least half.",thisbuttonsucks,4511,2020-06-30 14:15:25

One of my main tasks was to make calculation about how many people enlisted for a course, how many of them got discounts (unemployeds e.g.), how many men/women/age etc. That was needed to calculate upcoming courses fees etc. That was my only work there and I hated it.

This was in early 90s, so PCs were a thing in our offices but I had no idea how to write a program or use a database to use this informations. Lucky as I am our center had an interesting policy: when you want to educate yourself, you can attend that class for free. And when it's during the worktime, then this is worktime - as long as my supervisor is ok with that. She was.

So I spent 3 months ""studying"" database structures, scripting, coding etc. I told my tutor what I wanna do and he helped me to write a script that grabs all necessary informations from the courses-database, copy that into another database and then I went crazy and wrote code that was insane. I implemented ""what if"" scenarios thanks to filters. At the end I was able to do my work, that needed 6hrs a day within 15 minuntes. I mean, before that it took e.g. an hour to have all the necessary informations to have a ""how many unemployed single parent women does it need to make the costs of that course even. I had EVERYTHING back then. Now you want statistics how many single parent disabled foreign women at the age of 80-90 are needed for the next 2 years to keep the ornithology course running? Sure, no problem. Clickety-Click, done.

After that, I started the PC in the morning, grabbed all the data, ran my script, was done within 15 mins and then read the book I brought from home. At the end of the day I gave my supervisor several dozens of papers, statistics, predictions etc and said ""That was a lot of work!!"" and went home.

Got promoted because of the success of the project. 

I asked my boss why he put me in for it since I never done anything like that.

After his success he coasted for awhile until his record label dropped him for lack of output. At that point he created his own  label and cranked out hits like ""Rock Me Gently.""

Who is ""that guy"" for you, and what do you do to avoid him?",dcxylq,f2d3w6c,"Might get buried, but my dude in my head is literally Mr. Spock from Star Trek, and I don't avoid him.

Hear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.


Mr. Spock: ""The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful.""


Kirk: ""That's horrible!""


Spock: ""Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob.""


So, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. 


me: ""Spock, science report.""


Spock: ""Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes.""


me: ""Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!""


Spock: ""I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable.""


Just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.

EDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. 

One - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.

Two - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that ""getting gas"" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior ""science report"", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, ""godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*"" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, ""That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock."" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!

Three - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.

Four - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data.",godspeedmetal,15955,2019-10-03 23:52:12

AskReddit,What free things online should everyone take advantage of?,ecscwk,fbduupz,"1aauto.com

It is a car parts supplier, but their videos show exactly what tools you need, what parts you need, and how to do a repair yourself. Great money saver if you don’t know much about mechanics. Someone I knew was going to get screwed by their mechanic (700 bucks for a water pump replacement). Showed them that, they did it themselves for 30 bucks. It makes it quicker too, knowing what tools you need ahead of time for your particular car.

Edit: I agree they’re not the best for parts, this was just about their videos. For parts, rockauto.com is great. If you need an item quicker and have an Advanced Auto nearby, order online and pick up in store. They almost ALWAYS have a coupon online for at least 20% off, which you can apply and pick up in store, around 30 minutes later, yet save quite a bit versus just going in and buying.

Last edit: For those that are not mechanically inclined and do not want to mess with it, use Repairpal.com when you receive a quote and make sure the price is reasonable. It will give you a pretty general idea of what you should be paying in your area. It’s not 100%, but will help keep you from getting ripped off. Unfortunately, there are a lot of shops that will take advantage of a situation. Not saying all, of course, but that way you will know for sure.

For one thing, most of them would not care. My Senators are worth millions of dollars, they don't even notice their salary.

For another thing, *some* Congresspeople do really depend on their salary. This is their only source of income.

See the problem here? If we cut off their pay then the rich Congressmen have a weapon to use against the poorer Congressmen. There would be *more* government shutdowns and threats of shutdowns, and ""vote with me or lose your paycheck"" would become a viable, common tactic for the wealthier members of Congress.

A better idea would be to just stop voting for idiots. Or, more applicable to this audience: fucking vote.

Why, or why not?",aicgpz,eemq0zv,"Functionally - you would need an amendment rather than just a law.

Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:

>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

27th Amendment:

>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President. So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort.",ridersderohan,551,2019-01-21 17:58:11
AskReddit,"[Serious] Americans, would you be in support of putting a law in place that government officials, such as senators and the president, go without pay during shutdowns like this while other federal employees do? Why, or why not?",aicgpz,eems7gk,"This simple argument against it is that newer or less corrupt congressmen would be the only ones to suffer. If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. 

So this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?

I feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.

Additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.",ImadeAnAkount4This,326,2019-01-21 18:22:21

While morally I think it is great to have organs more readily available, I think you should NOT automatically be opted in.

My feelings on this stem from the technology industry.

Apps, Windows (microsoft), browsers, video games, they all automatically opt you in to their information gathering, email sending, text message viewing, invasive ""services"".

I personally think it should be illegal to have anyone automatically opt me in for anything.  Everything should be a default NO until I otherwise give my consent to it.

It also should be illegal to give out other people's information under the guise of ""if you recommend 5 friends, you get a free t-shirt"".  Because then all the sudden I am getting spam calls from Gyms, Window companies, scammers, all because some asshole that has my number decided to put me down as a recommendation.  Even asking to take me off lists, I still get calls.

Yes I am an organ donor.  Yes I wish more people were.  But No, I don't beleive anyone should be automatically opted in for anything.

No one should have to spend time, energy, or have to navigate tricky menus just to opt out of something they never agreed to in the first place.  Even if it is a simple 5 minutes of your time with an easy to navigate website.

It a bit like if the government by default can take my property when I am dead.

If you guys don't know the story u/Jasoninhell was a fellow Reddit user that posted his story regarding his wife's cheating with his neighbor on r/relationship_advice. r/relationship_advice told him that he will be better off divorcing his wife than to deal with her.  

A few days later he posts something on r/legaladvice to see how he can secure custody of his two children during the divorce.

His wife, named Brandi worley, found the r/legaladvice thread. 

The same day she found the reddit posts she kills both kids to spite her soon to be ex husband.

Brandi then calls 911 telling the operator that she stabbed herself and her 2 children because her husband was divorcing her, the call was recorded with Brandi showing no remorse or emotion during the call.

This whole situation was unfolding live on reddit and 4chan 

Brandi was given 120 years in prison with the jury saying ""She doesn't regret her decision not one bit.""

its deleted now though but i still have the full post.

Hello,

My girlfriend and me have done dating for 5 month. I thought ""This girl is very good,"" and became of love with her.

Yet even so, on this Monday, I comed home and found she as baked all my beans.

Yes, all. Oh brother.

In my cupboard I store several bag of bean, to make soft and to bake on some days, to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner. Or, heck, a lunch too some days.

But on the Monday I find this girlfriend baked all the beans. I say ""Why do you bake my beans"", and she say something as ""I bakes them good to save time, so I bakes them all now.""

I am astonished and full of dissmay. I say ""I canfr not eat all the beans"", she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time.

But, if a bean is froze and unfrozed, the very good and very nice flavor of bean is gone far.

A bean is best if baked fresh as a Sunday Pie. Not to be froze and unfroze!

I told my girfriend I am so sad of this, as to my opinion the baking of the beans and to freeze them has ruin all my beans. She say I am ""gone haywire"" by my enragement and sad manners.

But I hates what she did to my beans.

On the days before Monday I thought ""Will we marry the girlfriend? Well it might be so.""

But now I am so sad she baked them beans. I am consider to end our relations and not be the boyfriend and girlfriend any more. But, is my idea wrong? Could my girlfriend make promise to not bake the beans? I do not know what doing to do and how to feel forgiving on her.",Jackfruit_Reasonable,14643,2020-07-22 14:55:10

&#x200B;

It was a post in r/AmItheAsshole where an uber driver drove a girl to a restaurant where she was meeting her boyfriend. Before he dropped her off, he gave her a respectful comment (nothing inappropriate and without any bad intentions). He was asking if he was the asshole and the answer was no.

The best part happened in the comments section where somebody asked if he was living in a specific city. He replied a little freaked out with yes. Turn out it was the stranger cousin that he gave the compliment to. After he dropped her of at the restaurant, she went inside to meet her boyfriend. However it wasn't a nice night because he broke up with her. She told her cousin that the compliment that her uber driver gave her gave her some comfort or made her happy or something like that.

The girl and the uber driver then contacted each other through the cousin.

I don't know what happened afterwards but if somebody knows this post, I will give you a virtual hug if you could link it.

most of the data lost was work i published by then, so it would've been nice to keep the codes but losing them wasn't a major loss....... but one work was unpublished, thankfully it was recent so i was able to rewrite the code from memory and publish it 2 months ago.... so the damage was mostly controlled

thankfully, my professor is a very considerate person and didn't get pissed off as much as he could have....... and now i backup everything religiously, so lesson learned without significant lasting damage, thankfully

IT needed to upgrade the pc's firmware, and asked me to back up everything before giving it to them, since they would wipe the hdd...... i copied everything to dropbox, and once it copied only the subfolders, for some reason gave the green tick mark that means copying was done, so i didn't double check and just gave it to them...... i realized what happened later on, and by then they wiped the PC and turned the bits, so it was unrecoverable....... since my fiasco, IT enacted the policy that they will always backup the hdd of any PC before wiping it",dhekurbaba,14550,2020-11-07 01:06:39

AskReddit,How would you feel about a law that requires people over the age of 70 to pass a specialized driving test in order to continue driving?,70k2ya,dn488l6,"Sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time.

About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.

So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).

My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. 

Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.

Well she did, passed with ""Flying colors"" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.

1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.

Month later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.

At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was ""home from running around"" 

Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.

Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.

She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.

Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.

She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.

Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.

By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.

She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.

Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.

I have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.

If you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.

Its horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.

By them, I mean end of middle age and up. From going 30kmph in a 70kmph zone, to watching them stare out the side window while going through that same zone. They swerve from side to side. I refuse to go anywhere with my grandpa driving, as he is now a horrible driver and has nearly crashed the car multiple times, then blames it on other drivers. 

However, I won't say that only elderly people need to be tested. I would hate having to do so, but we ALL should be tested. Just last night teenagers drove over a schools fence in a large truck. People saw them, cops haven't caught them. Younger people speed more, usually 70 in a 50. 

In just today, I got stuck behind someone doing 20kmph in a 50 zone, and then while I was going 60kmph someone flew past me like I was standing still. The roads would be better if we were all retested, and in regards to my town, if cops would actually do their job. Going severely under the speed limit is dangerous just as speeding is.

Timeframe: As long as you can hold a beverage in your hand, because this might take awhile

Rules: Every player sits in front of the TV, with a beverage in hand (you should choose a good session beverage, this is going to get you proper fucked). As the impeachment process is progressing, players should be listening for the various chugging rules. When a rule is violated, each player must take a sip from their respective beverage. Don't rush this, honestly - be smart.

Chug Rules

* When someone says ""Quid Pro Quo"", raise your drink and salute, then chug

* When someone calls the whistleblower a liar/traitor, make a pirate arrrgh and sip

* When anyone uses a whataboutism, stand up, spin around 360, and consume

* If anyone mentions ""fake news"", smack your forehead and say ""duh"", then imbibe

* If anyone mentions Giuliani, take the little green man off your glass, then take a glug

* Put your thumb on the table anytime someone says ""witch hunt:, and the last person to do so takes one

* Whenever Pelosi is mentioned, the first person to ""Pelosi clap"" can give a drink to another player

Unfortunately it would necessarily leave out important info about the track record, reliability, competence, and honesty of the candidates.

Can't judge competence without knowing what positions & qualifications a candidate has held & their track record while doing so. Can't judge track record without basically knowing who the candidate is. Similarly w/ honesty; did the candidate lie about their presented info or lie in the past? Have they reliably held those beliefs, or are they liable to flip and disenfranchise their voters? How would voters hold politicians accountable across elections?

We need more and complete transparency from our candidates, not less. What we have now makes it relatively easy for candidates to keep hidden what was already hidden - we need info that drags everything relevant into the light (primarily financials).

To avoid political party bias/treating politics like football we need election reform in the form of another counting system like ranked pair voting that would help break up the two party system - not to just ignore political affiliations at the ballot box (both because then we wouldn't know if a political group packed a ballot, and because collectively organizing does do good things - we just need to be more fluid about shifting between those organizations as they and we change).

Edit: arguably, I think most of our problems (in the US) come from one side of the aisle publicly playing politics like a sport while privately selling out everything they can get their hands on, and the other side publicly espousing great things while failing to follow through in the name of ""moderation"" (i.e. actually being more like the other party than they want their voters to believe) while privately selling out (significantly less - this isn't a ""both sides problem"" - but just in a lot of the wrong places).",PerAsperaDaAstra,8,2020-02-19 00:16:17

August: The whole alien thing from June has started to affect how we view eachother on the planet. We are seeing a drastic and long lasting decline in terrorism and crime.

September: God blessed us all

October-November: Finally some normal and mundane events

December: Home Alone remake with the original cast. All I want for christmas is eradicated. You got a memorable present, and you made everyone truly happy with the ones you gave.

Edit: Not to be that thank you for all the awards guy, but I couln't keep it cool. I am grateful and glad to see all the positive comments. I don't have any psychic abilities, but I'm pretty sure this will come true, so I'm just happy to share.

Jan) rather than crazy bush fires in Australia, they invent an effective eradication method for Covid-19. 99% effective that basically reduces it to a cold, it's released to the world and enables all countries to stabilize.


Feb-Mar) unprecedented global free trade deals between most major powers, enabling nearly every country to financially recover and begin to prosper after 2020


Apr-may) the top 10% wealthiest people in the world decide to donate 10% of their funds back to society as a thank you to the world. This should effectively raise the socio-economic state of the bottom 50% of people. Increasing overall spending and helping small businesses around the world recover.


June-July) Peace in the middle East. The people of the middle eastern countries, fed up with their quality if life, finally get peace. Rebuilding of many destroyed city's and towns, a major upgrade to infrastructure in the areas.

Aug-Oct) cure for some forms of cancer is finally achieved. Mass rollout across the world, breakthroughs in other cancer treatments.


Nov-Dec) contact with our first Alien race, peaceful negotiations begin along with the trade of information and technology. A new age of enlightenment begins.

AskReddit,"Police Officers of Reddit, what are you thinking when you see cases like George Floyd?",grst2b,fs114a4,"Since we’re tapping into the police community here, can someone please explain what, if anything, the bystanders could have done to help George Floyd? Call 911 and report police brutality? In all seriousness, what is the preventative action here since none of the police officers on the scene (4 of which were physically restraining him) reacted to his being murdered right in front of them?

Edit: thank you u/murderbymodem for this link [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct). I’m adding it to my post because I think others will appreciate it and I don’t want it to get lost.

Edit: In summary, some of the options proposed are below. I apologize if I omitted, misrepresented, or oversimplified anything. *The bystanders in this case did many of these things and they were a voice for George when he couldn’t speak for himself.*

1. Always record the incident (live streaming if possible) and inform the police they are being recorded. 

2. Involve other authorities when applicable such as police supervisors, state police, 911 (ask for supervisor and an ambulance to report immediately), ACLU, FBI(?). Tell the officers on site that you are involving other authorities. 

3. Deescalation: back any crowd or bystanders away from the scene and officers (while still being able to record the incident). Have one person (preferably a white person) attempt to approach the officer(s) as a medical professional or voice of reason to explain that it appears that medical treatment may be required and remind the officer(s) that their best interests (career, family, reputation etc) are to act responsibly. 

4. Create a diversion/distraction that requires the officers to release the hold (not custody) of anyone in imminent medical danger. 

5. Physically remove the threat imposed by the officer(s) by force (this includes exercising your right to carry and discharge a gun). I think everyone agrees that this option will most likely result in physical (potentially fatal) and legal ramifications for the individual(s) involved unless the group of bystanders are organized enough and outnumber the officers on the scene to the extent that they can safely take control without further harm. 

6. Systemic change: Vote (local and national) for people that value human life and will implement change to protect it (this is not an anti-gun sentiment - if you value your right to carry a gun then vote for people that support that). Be vocal in demanding justice when these incidents occur. Push for improved training, hiring practices, and accountability within the police force. I would imagine that this may also include increasing pay for the police force to attract more suitable individuals into the positions. Possibly implement a citizen based governing body to oversee the police force and their actions.",Amalchemy,33105,2020-05-27 22:42:49

We’re trained that anything involving the neck is a no-go and is considered deadly force. 

We were also trained that if you make an arrest in a prone position, you search and then immediately move them onto their side or a seated position because the risk of asphyxiation is so great. If a suspect says they can’t breathe, believe them and take measures to correct to it.

There is no police academy training officers to kneel on someone's neck to subdue them, That's how you kill a person. 

 There is extensive training on how to avoid seriously injuring a person while restraining them, and I guarantee you every one of these officers was trained to never strike a person in the neck or choke them.

The officer who killed him is very clearly liable for manslaughter at the very least, and I think the other officers who stood by have some accountability as well because they knew damn well that was not how you handle a person, and should have stepped up.",McFeely_Smackup,27924,2020-05-28 01:26:34

Based in Scotland, I'm a Police Officer with 5 years service, 2 of which I have been a part-time Officer safety instructor.

During this training we go over retraining subjects and handcuff techniques that we use to a T.  This includes all safety aspects including where to apply handcuffs, how tight they should be, ensuring the technique is done correctly and that the subject is in a controlled but safe position.

Positional asphyxia is a VITAL topic we cover and it is reiterated time and time again that if a subject ends up on the ground we never, and I reiterate again, NEVER, place any sort of weight on them. 
Hell even when sitting in the back of our cars, we watch them and ensure they can breath and are in a comfortable position for transport.

EDIT: This is my first comment and it has received more attention that I could have imagined, which I thank you all for!

To address some points raised in the replies.  I appreciate I work in a far different environment but we still have to restrain subjects while cuffed and at no point has it resulted in an incident like this or even an Officer in the position shown in the video.

I absolutely condemn his actions and this should never have happened.  As for what was going on his head, I have no idea whether it be ""red mist"" or he thought something else.  Either way he should lose his job and face the full consequences of his action.

Unfortunately some hate, as expected, in some replies which I understand.  However one officer cannot be held accountable for another, so again I hope people understand that this a small minority of the job and the rest are always there to help.

I'm a lieutenant in my home town police department. I started my day by showing the video to my officers and making sure my people understood that this is murder, plain and simple. You never, outside of a life and death struggle, do anything like this. 

George Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground. If he was still struggling badly enough that they felt a need to hold him down, there's a hundred ways to do it safely. Use of force should always be as measured and considered as possible. There will always be times where an officer sees danger and has to make a split second decision without the luxury of weighing the consequences. That clearly was not the case here. He had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing. He had multiple people there telling him to stop. And none of his fellow officers intervened. All of that is why I find this incident particularly disgusting. They had so many chances to do the right thing. 

Luckily, I have the fortune of working with good people who see this shit for what it is. Before the video was over, before I told them that George Floyd died because of this, my officers were muttering things like, ""What the fuck is he doing?"" ""You can't do that shit"" and ""He needs to get off the man's fucking neck!"" Made me way prouder to be their leader than any number of arrests they could make to see that their instincts were not to defend the officer. 

For what it's worth, I'm glad that they were fired. I've heard mention in this thread that one of the officers has been arrested, which is great if true. I hope they're all brought to justice. Their actions (and lack thereof) were completely unconscionable.",Wolfhound1142,9959,2020-05-28 03:20:03

AskReddit,"Police Officers of Reddit, what are you thinking when you see cases like George Floyd?",grst2b,fs3j2x7,"I am a police officer in a medium sized suburban town in Texas. I have been in law enforcement for 14 years. I love my job, I love how I get to help people and I love how I get to cause positive changes in peoples' lives. I love how 99.9% of the time, my badge is shiny...today my badge is not shiny.

I am tired of hearing the excuses given by other people for a police officer's misconduct. I am tired of excuses being made for people who tarnish my badge. I am so tired of hearing how officers have a stressful job and their misconduct was a result of that stress. You know who else is under stress? The people who called us, that person whose loved one just committed suicide, the family who called us because they found grandma dead and now we're asking everyone questions, the 7-11 clerk who just had a gun shoved in his face, and even the guy we just put in handcuffs and told him he is losing his freedom. Sorry, but our stress is low compared to these folks. We might have to go into these situations, but we get to leave them and pretend none of that shit ever happened after our shift is over.

I am tired of hearing excuses for the bad police officers, I am tired of the excuse ""well, he puts his life in danger"". Sure, I know we put our lives in danger, I've had guns, knives and even swords pulled on me. I've responded to bomb threats, suicidal subjects, assaults in progress, robberies in progress, etc. You know who else puts their lives in danger? Fire fighters, deep sea fisherman, loggers, people who step foot outside their homes in Chicago. We are trained to deal with danger, we are provided with equipment and training to help us survive those dangers. Do I face an increased risk of not going home? Sure, but that's why I am at an increased level of awareness at work, so I can respond to threats appropriately without panic and over responding.

I am tired of hearing about the thin blue line. I believe in the thin blue line, I believe in looking out for my fellow officers. I don't believe in hiding the misconduct or unlawfulness of other officers, and I have always spoken up. What many forget, standing behind the thin blue line doesn't mean concealing the misconduct of other officers, it means confronting those officers so they don't do something to ruin their lives, the lives of others, or violate the law or code of conduct. It means walking up to the officer with his knee on a suspect's neck and saying ""dude, this is too much, stop"", before the officer commits murder. It means walking up to the officer who has been drinking all night and saying ""dude, I'll give you a ride home"". Instead of hiding misconduct, prevent it, help your fellow officer not do something to ruin his life or another's life. If you do see misconduct, address it, take it to the appropriate level, stop tarnishing my badge. We took an oath to uphold the law, uphold our ethics and protect our communities, sometimes that means arresting other police officers or holding them accountable for policy/ethics violations.

This officer violated the rights of George Floyd and murdered him through his actions. The officers who were on scene and failed to act are just as responsible. There are multiple videos of this incident and there is no real question as to what happened.

For those folks who wonder what makes it murder or manslaughter. Murder is the act of causing death to another human being through an action which a reasonable person would know (or intend) could result in the death of the victim. Manslaughter is the act of causing death through an act which is reckless in nature.

Every officer in America is taught about positional asphyxiation and while some departments allow neck restraints, all officers are taught the dangers of neck restraints and are taught not to apply pressure to the back of someone's neck or head when they are proned out on the ground in handcuffs.

Floyd was handcuffed with little resistance and they were able to walk him across the street to a patrol unit. Floyd can be seen in a surveillance video falling to the ground next to the unit on the sidewalk side of the unit. Cell phone footage then shows the officer on top of Floyd's neck on the opposite side of the unit, the street side. There is a random man in the background telling Floyd just to get in the car and he can't win. Floyd can be heard saying he knows and he's done. This implies that Floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape, but was still restrained in the handcuffs. Floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can't breathe. The cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes, with around four of those minutes with Floyd being unconscious.

Even if Floyd did attempt to resist or escape, there was no reason to hold him down for eight minutes. What was the point of restraining him for so long? Why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining Floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker? Why did the primary officer continue to restrain Floyd by his neck after Floyd became unresponsive? Why can the officer be heard at some point asking Floyd if he is still a tough guy? I can only come up with one answer to all of these questions, and that was the primary officer, Chauvin, wanted to prove to Floyd that Floyd was not such a tough guy. I see an officer assaulting another human being, going beyond taking control of a suspect, using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being. I see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing, despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy. I see officers who were trying to get back at Floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they KNEW could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force.

This officer committed murder, plain and simple. This officer tarnished my badge and the badges of all police officers. Worst of all, this officer tortured his victim for eight minutes, imagine your last thoughts and memories being those of a police officer, a person who the public is supposed to be able to trust, placing his body weight on your neck, slowly asphyxiating you against hot asphalt while he asks you if you're still a tough guy. I hope this officer, and any officer who allowed this to happen, is tried and convicted. It's going to be some time before I can polish my badge back to a shine, in the mean time, a family is suffering, a community is burning, all because of one guy who should have never been an officer.

I am proud of my career and my department. I think my department is lucky to have pretty strong support in our community. Support comes from trust that when a citizen has to come in contact with the police in some way, they will be treated with respect. 

Regardless of what kind of training those officers had or lacked, no one with common sense or good intentions would kneel on someone’s neck, especially after they’d been handcuffed, while they stated multiple times that they couldn’t breathe. At no point in the academy was I taught that knee-to-the-neck was an appropriate hold for a suspect. In fact, I WAS taught about positional asphyxiation. And that a “choke hold” or carotid restraint that cuts off circulation to the brain is deadly force. 

When a combative suspect is handcuffed and is no longer able to hurt you, you sit them up and call for medical if they were injured during the arrest. I have made and assisted with many, many arrests and nothing I saw in the George Floyd video is normal. I can’t even fathom what that officer was thinking. 

As far as the officers standing by, helping to hold Mr. Floyd down, and failing to intervene when he says he can’t breathe... unacceptable. My department’s policy says that officers shall intervene if they are witnessing a fellow officer using excessive force. Regardless of whether the officer using excessive force is a 30 year vet and the witness is a rookie. If it’s a sergeant and the witness is his/her subordinate. These are people’s lives at stake and police officers have too much power if we aren’t willing to police each other. 

I rarely make judgments on fellow officers without knowing the whole story, but the video of George Floyd’s arrest is enough. Mr. Floyd was murdered and those officers had every opportunity to change the outcome of that situation. They are not worthy of their badge. I’m relieved that their department was decisive enough to immediately fire them and I fully expect they will be prosecuted. 

I’ve seen many people commenting, “Why don’t police officers speak up?” and “Why do the police continue to participate in this corruption?” We aren’t ‘participating’. If we stop showing up to work and doing our jobs, violence and crime will rule. I haven’t talked to a single officer who isn’t disgusted by what happened in Minneapolis. I’m incredibly angry because the actions of those cops put a target on every other cop’s back - good cops who would never, ever do something like that. The law enforcement community as a whole is in agreement that George Floyd’s death was completely unacceptable and unnecessary. 

If anyone bothered to read this, please don’t condemn all police because of the actions of those few. There’s no excuse for it, but the vast majority of police officers are truly good people.

When that’s the point we’re starting at from the standpoint of community relations/trust, things like this only make our job harder. Add to that a populace that will frequently fight police because they have nothing to lose, and we’re in a bad spot.

And ""the media only covers the bad stuff that happens with cops what about black on black crime."" All the garbage you always hear after this happen right from the mouth of the horse in their state HQ. So to all the ""cops of reddit"" I see on this thread that are saying this is shameful and whenever it happens y'all are ashamed and find it disgusting. Then hold each other accountable because in the police HQ I worked at the culture that allows these things to happen was readily apparent.

AskReddit,"Police Officers of Reddit, what are you thinking when you see cases like George Floyd?",grst2b,fs1491z,"Something to keep in mind.

Cops, like every other group on the planet, have a few very bad cops, a few very good cops and a whole lot who fall in the middle.  Cops are no different than any other person, most just do their jobs as best they can.

The bad part is that one bad cop makes all the other cops look bad, especially in today's climate where the news run the story over and over and over.  Email administrators don't all get spat on and flipped off when one of them does something bad.  Name any other group and you never see this kind of treatment.

Before you say it, a lot of people in a lot of professions have a lot of control over your life, not just cops.

Edit:  Just a few more thoughts based on the 100 comments I got on this.

First, if you say all cops are bad then you are just as guilty of bias and prejudice as the cop who targets black people.  There is no group that is all bad, period.

Next:  I've been driving for 50 years and had something of a lead foot so had more than my share of interactions with police.  In the old days, if a cop pulled you over, you got out of the car and interacted with him or her in a polite manner.  That is what was expected.  If you stayed in your car, the cop just walked up and had a chat.  The last time I got out of my car at a stop, probably some time in the 80s, I was told over the loud speaker to get back in.  The cops now walk up and stand behind the window with their hand on their gun.  We used to have a grudgingly respectful attitude toward the police, now we just want to give them a load of shit and since way too many people have guns, they have to be constantly on guard or get shot.  Who's fault is that?

Lastly, yes, a silent cop is at fault but that doesn't make them a bad cop.  I saw a lot of bad shit in my career in IT, shit that could have gone in the newspaper but seldom said anything other than reporting it to my boss for lots of reasons, mostly because my career would have been over and worst, nothing would have changed.  I think that is what most ""good"" cops face, report someone to the press and lose your job or worse.  Pick any whistleblower in history and see how they were treated, that's simply not something your normal every day run of the mill person, in any profession is generally willing to face.  

It's really easy to sit behind our computers and pass judgement, on the basis of ONE PICTURE before anyone has heard the rest of the story.  No, that guy should not have died and should not have been treated that way but to condemn every policemen because of it is just stupid.",bigedthebad,239,2020-05-27 23:10:37

His life was played out in biographies and documentaries, most recently *The Theory of Everything,* in which Eddie Redmayne played him. “**At times I thought he was me**,” Hawking said on watching the film.

Editing to add:

Since so many are asking what to get: Victorinox 8"" or 10"" chef's knife, and 10"" lodge cast iron skillet. These in my opinion are at the tippy top of the curve on quality to price ratio. 

These probably leave enough room in the budget to get a $2 steel from goodwill and a large butcher block cutting board. As long as you use the steel with some regularity, a good knife should go a long time before it actually needs to be sharpened.

Second edit: I agree that a good sharpener is important, but if you have $100 to spend today you can wait on sharpener as long as you have a steel to maintain the edge. You will need one, but not today.

Edit: I feel like a few people are being deliberately negative about this. For those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars I encourage you to temper your expectations of what ""good"" is and check out amazon right now. If you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now. Ceramic cookware is what I started learning to cook on.  Its not perfect but it's a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there. If you prefer iron like I do, lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now. Pair that with a decent chef's knife from Mercer $45 (the brand I am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating.) And you're good to go. Those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them. A shepherd's pie, pizza, fresh bread, soups and stews, stir fry..... I mean almost anything.  Pro tip, even if it says preseasoned, look up how to season it anyway. And never use soap on your iron.  Scrub it in the sink under hot water, heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast, when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils.

* Minimalism/Flat design, mostly due to the rise of tablets and browsing the internet on mobile devices. Clean lines, simple colors like black, white and grey.

* TV commercials: Early 2010s ads are backed by upbeat xylophone/triangle/whistling/hand clapping music, or people breakdancing or doing “the worm” to obnoxious dubstep music. The late 2010s have vivid colors and imagery, vaporwave-style aesthetics, and loud over-the-top spokespeople talking fast in the middle of the screen (think “Captain Obvious” from the Hotels.com commercials or Terry Crews from the Old Spice commercials)

* Entering a new golden age of automotive design. Almost every new car from the decade is elaborately styled. Car interiors with angular, intricate dashboards (like the Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox or Hyundai Santa Fe). This might end in the 2020s as crash safety technology requires more new cars to look the same, and car interiors will replace dashboards and gauges with touch screens (Thanks, Tesla).

* A move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting, outdoor tables with giant Jenga blocks, Edison bulbs, and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard.

* All houses are painted in that “griege” color and have all-white kitchens with that same white subway tile backsplash. There is probably a barn door, shiplap accent wall, and a fiddle-leaf fig inside.",Meetybeefy,13674,2019-09-06 18:50:59

* Obama/Trump. Obama was elected last decade, but most of his term was this decade. He got Bin Laden, passed healthcare, and triggered a whole bunch of people just because he was Black. Then Trump really popped up in 2015 for his presidential run (was it really that long ago?) and he's been at the forefront of news ever since.

* An increase in small-dollar donations for political candidates, especially on the left.
* Increasing partisanship between the left and the right.
* A swing towards progressivism on the left (as seen by the rise of Sanders, Warren and AOC).
* The (slow) weakening of the Religious Right, as evidenced by the willingness of evangelicals to look the other way on their 'moral purity' tests, and the (depressingly speedy) rise of the Nationalist Right.

I am also in the really cool position of being able to watch my children absorb and adjust so flawlessly and so selflessly to this current state of the world.  We don’t give these kids enough credit, we really don’t.  They are carrying this society right now and just displaying such an incredible level of grace and flexibility; not just mine but most children.  They are struggling, too but just in a way that is so innocent, so devoid of politics or bias compared to the adults and they are discovering strengths and abilities within themselves that I think most adults should really admire.  I’m proud of these damn kids and they keep me going.

I wanted to edit to add: I appreciate people’s concern and care for me so much.  I am so lucky to have a good support system and I am okay.  I am safe.  I have thoughts but never plans because I do absolutely know my value.

I don’t know if this will make sense to anyone else, but I love colors. I especially like the idea of colors being associated with ideas, personalities, names or themes. “Oh, today is Monday. I think orange is a good Monday color. Pink is Friday. Green is Wednesday.” I love how Windows 10 allows me to change the colors of tiles so that my computer seems more like “me.” I am constantly changing the colors of my Apple watch face. 

I dunno. I think I have a problem!

ETA: The thoughts and discussions being shared here have been very interesting and eye-opening! Thanks for the silver as well. :) I do just want to add that I am fairly certain I do not have synesthesia. I know someone that does and from my very limited knowledge of it, it isn’t a voluntary association of colors like mine probably would be. I always automatically like to associate stuff with color or mood, but I don’t know that it happens involuntarily. Think of what I do as more of what happens in the video game Persona 5, where each character has a color associated with them intentionally.

Or, an alternative way. I use black for titles and subtitles, as, for me, the title isn't that important. The dates are written in a subtle color, because the focus should be on the stuff below. I'm not focusing on the title, more on the definitions, key words, diagrams, instructions etc. Blue is the most used, as that's usually what I use for simple stuff. Red is used for diagrams, definitions and instructions and research shows that red helps with more detailed information than blue. Also, red is cool. I highlight key words in pastel pink because it looks pretty with blue and highlight in pastel orange because fire and shit. As for the summary, I write it in grey with a black border.

Nowadays, she only uses one color to take notes... but she leaves dozens upon dozens of color-coded tags in every book that she reads (whether it's fiction or nonfiction). Those are all indexed according to an arcane system that the likes of mortal men may not comprehend, although if you should unwarily run your thumb along that rainbow of plastic, the resulting sound will resemble that of a dark, eldritch chant.

I should pause for a moment here to offer a disclaimer: This woman's personality has always been very, *very* different from that of the girls who simply wanted their notes to look pretty. While she definitely cares about aesthetics (and has a great eye for them), her color-based note-taking system is actually meant as a method of organization. Put another way, if she had been a ""horse girl,"" it would have been because she'd needed a ""vehicle"" that would run on oats. If she'd been a ""volleyball girl,"" it would have been because she had figured out a sports-based method of conquering the planet.

Anyway, as for where she is now, well, the truth sounds like an exaggeration: She grew up to become one of the most stunningly beautiful women on the planet, coming into her own at around the same time that she was getting her doctorate degree in a hard science. Following that, she decided that she needed more of a challenge, so she became a financial analyst at one of the most successful investment management firms on the planet. She attributes her personal success to how much she reads... and I've already described her reading process.

AskReddit,"Girls who took notes using 50 different colored pens, where are you now? Do you still continue to write using all those colors?",euoqp6,ffroewm,"It's my time to shine!

I really sucked at taking notes. I failed out of 7th grade. I scraped by in high school. I got into the lowest tier university in the state only because they automatically accepted anyone with an ACT score over 21. Then I flunked out. 

Twice. 

I eventually did graduate with a degree (that I never used), but it was with a 2.7 GPA. This is just to demonstrate how awful I was at note-taking, studying, anything involving recording and retaining information of the academic persuasion. 

Then I decided I was really tired of living below the line of poverty and got a master's in science. This required being at the very least passable at recording and retaining academic information. 

This is where the copious color-coded pens came in. And the color-coded highlighters. And the color-coded sticky notes. And the color-coded accordion folders. 

I was finally able to properly record information in a way I could retain, which led to my appointment as research assistant, then contributions to multiple academic publications, and ultimately a dream job at the R&D division of a certain computer company. Colored pens got me out of poverty  and gave me the ability to help provide for my family.

Because a second cyclone hit occurred during their breeding cycle, instead of drying out and having most of their population die out in the desert, the population exploded.

I mean, comets are notoriously tricky to predict in brightness, as it might just break apart as it gets closer to the sun.  But it's really exciting to think about, albeit no one has heard about it because of the pandemic (though granted, doesn't a pandemic need a bright comet?).

Edit: you might be able to get it in binoculars right now, or at least have fun trying!  [Here](https://heavens-above.com/comet.aspx?cid=C%2F2019%20Y4&lat=50&lng=15&loc=%C4%8CR&alt=270&tz=CET) is a star chart for it.

And yes, the last bright northern hemisphere ""Great Comet"" was Hale-Bopp, which was up for about a year to the naked eye.  If you were a southern hemisphere resident in 2006, however, you probably remember Comet McNaught.

Edit 2: because many are asking, that bright “star” in the evening sky is actually Venus! It’s around its peak brightness and height *right now* and you should go take a look if your social distancing allows it! Might as well take a break from Netflix and look at a whole ‘nother planet. :)

So I'm going to go the totally sane route and instead raise another $1000 somewhere in nickels. I find the same guy who scammed me for the brick, and *re-scam* him. Perform the transaction in person, wearing a mask so he doesn't recognize me. I demand the money in cash beforehand, and we meet up. He hands me 10 $100 bills - my hard-earned money.

I consider it for a moment, inspecting each of the bills before nodding once and tucking it neatly into my coat. I turn around, inputting 6 digits into a wall-mounted safe. Inside is a brick and a remote. I turn around to him, offering the brick as I slip the remote into my pocket alongside the cash.

""Wait a minute..."" Realization begins to dawn on his face. ""You're... you're that guy from before.""

""I am.""

""Look, I'm sorry, man, but reddit made me do it. I'm sorry, but I'm not buying a thousand-dollar brick from you.""

""That's ok."" I turn around, tossing the brick back into the safe, where it lands with a *thunk* against the metal.

""Could I at least get my money back?""

""Sure. Have it back."" Reaching into my jacket pocket, my hand instead comes out with the remote. He begins to realize that something is wrong, but before he can do anything, I press the button and a hidden hatch in the ceiling above him slams open.

20,000 nickels rain down with a monstrous roar, instantly crushing him under 100 Kg (~220 lb) of metal. I'm still out a total of $1000, but this time it was worth it.",DelicousPi,12,2019-03-03 00:07:05

Edit: I didn’t realize I’d start a discussion so I’ll add to my answer.  “Bookshelf” can mean anything from actual bookshelf to ereader to even just a list of books they’ve read.  I love to read and can’t imagine being with someone who has no interest in learning. It’s not so much WHAT someone reads so long as they show an interest in learning, expanding their minds, and enjoying a good story.  Seeing their bookshelf can tell you a lot about what interests they have and the interests you share. You don’t have to like the same books at all - in fact I love the idea of sharing my favorite books with someone who’s never read them (but will hopefully enjoy them) and vice verse.",wanderingstorm,3259,2020-02-16 10:36:58

She did many other questionable things, and I reported her multiple times, as did my coworkers (and customers).

Now, one time i got lucky and an 18 yo kid came in yo buy the most expensive desktop we have on display. 2.5k. she saw me do this sale, but i needed a manager to approve a tiny discount, but my radio was dead.

When i return, she literally yells at me in front of the customer to give her the sale bc she worked too. I ignored her & didn't give her the sale.

When i reported this (as did the customer, he was mortified), i was literally told by my boss ""ignore when she does that. She's a middle child, so she does stuff like that"" 

I was tired of the stupid lack of action, so i filed an HR complaint regarding her......and five of my managers for not addressing it. They all got reamed for it. Only one is still in a management position, the rest were eventually demoted or laid off.",seungri423,22137,2020-01-04 06:43:59

I wasn't a super bright teenager, but had enough sense to spend my last $20 on pepper spray and padlocks for my stuff. Predictably, people's stuff went 'missing' all the time. 

I could write an essay on the issues in the public welfare system, ranging from the macro level (lack of funding) to the micro level (incompetent or burnt out staff). There was violence, substance use, and sexual assault in crisis accommodation, but what bothers me ten years later is the sheer *stupidity* of some adults who are meant to guide at-risk teenagers. I would ask my social worker questions like, are there places which can help me with food this week? How do I write a resume? And that social worker would vaguely shrug and offer relaxation techniques and mindfulness strategies. Look, three people got arrested at this shelter last week, no amount of 'relaxation techniques' are going to calm me down. 

I'm guilty of doing stupid and irresponsible things as a teenager, but eventually finished high school and then 3 university degrees. I actually work for the same system that I was and am disappointed in, and there are so many practical resources available. They're underutilized because staff don't even know they're out there. If I had just a single adult to help me with the most simple tasks as a kid, it would have been so much easier. When you're a kid you just don't know how university loan applications, taxes, budgeting, etc works. Or at least I didn't. And everybody assumes that you do, because *they* do. Like I had no idea that in my country, the Department of Housing can pay for your rental bond. I stayed in a homeless shelter for an extra 1-2 months to save up $900 to pay for the bond of a shitty apartment. Extra months of broken sleep, men trying to pick the lock to my door, residents hyped up on ice. 

Last year there was a 16 year old girl on the train, having a meltdown and making a public scene. She was clearly drunk and people were avoiding her. She started screaming that she missed her period and does anybody want to pay for her termination. She phrased it as a joke or a way to get money (which I did not give). But I guess she repeated it enough that I wondered if it was true. We got to talking and I referred her to a social service, downloaded a list of resources in her catchment area, and saved links and forms on her phone about how to arrange her own healthcare cards since she's over 15, so that she can visit a bulk-billing GP on her own and get tested. In my country, the pee test from a pharmacy is about $15 but a pregnancy blood test ordered by your GP is free. We discussed different options that her GP might outline and other things that might be helpful. 

I know as well as anyone else that it's not always that straight-forward - especially with 30 patients in your caseload and juggling them with a million other priorities. But in the biopsychosocial framework of health - where biological, psychological, and social factors are proposed to impact physical and mental health - we severely underestimate the impact of social circumstances. We let these kids down all the time, and it's preventable.",manlikerealities,19598,2020-01-04 06:10:19

He didn't. He left my room and left the revolver on my dresser as he walked out. I took the revolver and went out. I walked around my hometown, sat by the river and thought about all the ways I could get back at him for all the misery he caused my mother, sister, and I.

I also considered doing the ol' Kurt Cobain but that's not relevant.

I was physically bullied, verbally mocked, humiliated in front of the other kids, and not an eye was batted. When I finally took my mom's advice to make a scene the next time someone started throwing things at me, I did it. We were outside that day for P.E. and while we were all sitting in lines at the start of class a kid in the line next to me started throwing pebbles at me. I ignored it for a moment, then when he kept going I yelled at him to stop. I didn't care that people were staring, I wanted them to. I wanted them to see that this average-height, able-bodied boy was throwing things at me, a very small and disabled girl. The teacher came over and asked what happened. Kid told him they were only pebbles, he wasn't hurting me. The teacher agreed with him and told me if I ever disrupted his class like that again I was getting detention.

I don't know what it is about some teachers but the second they get put in charge of more than one child they become absolutely blind to any kind of bullying, and if it gets pointed out to them, they think that particular incident exists in a vacuum and couldn't possibly be a sign of anything worse. I was 11 years old and suicidal because I felt so incredibly powerless. That teacher only solidified that feeling.",None,11922,2020-01-04 05:34:43

There was a long period of time where there was constant fighting, and things often went too far. I didn't feel safe in many different ways.

It all culminated to a point when I was 17, disowned, and about to get kicked out. But, my vindictive, defensive actions in the past made my mother know that kicking me out wasn't a good idea. I know the only reason I could have a roof over my head was becuase my mom isn't a citizen, and she knews I would have reported her for the crime of child abuse (which did happen) which would have put her residency in jeopardy.

So, I guess I had to threaten to burn the village in order to feel the warmth of safety.

AskReddit,"African Proverb Says ""The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel the warmth"" What time in your life have you been closest to starting the fire?",ejr5rg,fd0qbvw,"For some reason or another, my mother hated me. As a little girl I could never understand why she treated me so much worse than my 3 other siblings, and I would often go up to my Grandmother and ask her ""Why doesn't my momma love me?"" She never could give me a straight answer and would tell me ""Your momma loves you in the only way she knows how..."". That answer confused me because she loved my siblings just fine (Disclaimer: Her love was toxic AF, and she did a different type of damage to my other siblings.). 

Now when I say that my mother treated me badly, it started out with her picking fights with me. She would constantly nitpick at everything I  did, chastising me, and at the end of the day punishing me harshly for something that could have been a gentle scolding. When I got older, she started cussing at me, and calling me names. She would often ignore me for days on end, and when she would talk to me it would be to make me the butt end of a bad joke, or to tell me she hated me. 

Yes, my mother looked me dead in my eyes and told me she hated me (Disclaimer #2: She was a drug addict and alcoholic, and she loves to claim all the emotional abuse she put me though as a child was the effects of the drugs, and it ""wasn't even that bad""). It was things like that that really began to tear at me after awhile. All sorts of terrible things she did to me growing up, the terrible things she said, and how she ignored me constantly... All of it very different than how she treated my other three siblings.

She was very close with one of my brothers and my sister. She would spend time with them constantly, take them anywhere, buy them anything that they wanted and it made me resent them. My sister would sometimes rub it in my face that ""Mom loved her more"". It was her way of having power over me, and it was one of the things that made my rage bubble over on innocent people.

I just wanted to be loved and accepted, I wanted to be cared for and cherished as a child should be, and when I didn't get that, I plotted on how I was going to get her love and affection. In my screwed up mind, I thought that if I got rid of my older brother and younger sister... I would be one of the only people left for her to love. 

I planned on killing my brother. How screwed up is that? It wasn't just some thought that passed through my head; it was a constant idea, a plan that I was putting into place to end his life so that I could make room in my mother's heart for me.

I feel ashamed writing it out. It was a dark time in my life, and I was also incredibly mentally ill. 

My brother was addicted to pain medications, and my parents were trying desperately to get him clean at the time. Ironically, at the same time he was going on a drug induced rampage, my sister had shattered her leg on a trampoline. She was on some pretty heavy pain pills, and while my mother was doing everything in her power to keep my brother away from the drugs, she would leave my sister (and her drugs) in my care. So one day, while my mother was out dealing with my brother and my sister was sleeping, I took the rest of her pills (my sister was super afraid of becoming addicted to drugs after watching what my mother and brother were going through, so there was a ton left) and I waited for my brother to come back. 

When I heard him come through his window (His room was next to mine) I went into the kitchen and made him a glass of juice. Earlier in the day I had crushed up the pills into a powder, and I mixed them into the juice. I went up to his room, knocked on the door, and offered him the cocktail of various prescription drugs. He took the juice, and right before he was about to drink it I had  thought.

""How could I do this to my own brother?"" 

I snatched the drink back, and it spilled all over the carpet. He was high and super pissed, but at least he was alive. 

I never tried anything like that again. It felt so sick, wrong, evil... I mean, what type of person thinks about killing their brother?  Besides, my brother dying wouldn't make my mother love me any more, she would have just resented me for living instead of him.

So thats' the sad, sick story of how I almost executed my brother. I didn't actually carry through with it, obviously, and I guess everyone lived happily ever after. My brother got clean and now has a happy family, I'm in college, my sisters leg healed up nicely, and my mom left us after awhile... (But thats' a story for another time).",RandomKay300,2912,2020-01-04 07:18:46

My anger and sadness continued to grow. One Thursday night my father picked up my siblings for the obligatory meal out. I declined to go. I went into my room and started fucking around with my chemistry set. Picture this setting; a farmhouse built in 1830, burlap walls in my bedroom, hundreds and hundreds of comic books, and wall to wall carpeting. Your standard tinderbox. Instead of using a bunson burner for my heat source get this...I used an empty plastic Margarine container. And instead of practicing any other safety protocol, I set the fuel on the carpet and lit it. Surprise, the plastic melted almost immediately and the fuel soaked the carpet. Before I ""knew"" what happened flames were licking the walls and furniture.

  At this point I had the good sense to yell ""fire"" to my mother who was blissfully unawares in the kitchen. She dialed 911, while the child genius ran in and out of the inferno trying to save his Marvel's and D.C.'s. Thankfully the emergency services got there quickly and were able to contain the damage to my bedroom. It was completely blackened.

AskReddit,"African Proverb Says ""The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel the warmth"" What time in your life have you been closest to starting the fire?",ejr5rg,fd097ok,"I grew up in a dysfunctional family, though feeling very loved cause I was the youngest. I’m from a culture where you’re not supposed to be gay. So I always knew that I was loved for the wrong reason and that the moment I’d come out, everybody would hate me to the core. The facade I kept up with lasted into my mid 20s and then one day, I just exploded and updated my social media, coming out. My family hasn’t spoken to me since then. It’s been 6 years. I guess the fire is still burning!

Edit: Wow. Thank you all for your kind words. It means a lot. I know a lot of you are concerned, but I have found my own family. I have a best friend who’s there for me from when I wake up til when I go to bed and vice versa.. Had she been a guy, we’d probably be married by now 😂.

I also feel that I need to clear something up. One of my brothers still speaks to me.  I get to speak to his children and he has changed my view from how I used to look at him. Growing up, he had a mental illness and in my family, we never believed in that either. And I feel terrible because remembering when I was a young teenager all the way until I turned 20, I used to be angry at him saying that I didn’t believe in his “attention seeking”. It was taking a toll on the family and I was mad at him for a long time. I’ve said stuff that I’ll probably have to live with for the rest of my life. Whereas when I came out, he’s the only who didn’t stop talking to me. The “crazy” (the way mentally ill people are viewed in the culture) family member is the only one who was there for me. I never mentioned that in my original post and I feel like it’s something that should be mentioned. 
And today, I’d put him above everyone else in my family, no matter if they’d come around or not. 
Around after I came out, he got into one of his episodes and nobody cared to talk him into getting to the hospital to start his meds again. I was on phone with him from the other side of the world for three days until I convinced him to get into the hospital where they helped him. I like to think that he forgives me for the things I used to say nowadays because I’m doing everything to make him know that I feel like there’s absolutely nothing wrong with his mental illness.

AskReddit,"African Proverb Says ""The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel the warmth"" What time in your life have you been closest to starting the fire?",ejr5rg,fd2lwd2,"I have two sisters. One older, and one younger. My mom worked hard to make sure each of us felt special and loved. My dad? Not so much. He called my older sister *Princess* and my little sister was referred to as *Little Buddy*. For whatever reason, I got kind of forgotten about. I didn't mind most of the time. I found my dad annoying, demanding, and at times unreasonable. I hated the way he bullied my mom and would lash out about things that didn't make sense. Basically, I thought of my dad at a total brat. He'd have a bad day at work, and would find someone to take it out on. Usually, my mom and I. But I still tried. I'd try to cuddle up with him, feeling hurt when he'd shrug me off and tell me I need to shower. I made gifts for him. Got good grades, won poetry contests. Won awards through bible quiz. Never argued. But it never seemed to work. Before long, he'd find something to yell at me about. Things that usually didn't make sense. If my little sister and I fought, the whole thing was my fault. My feet turn in. I hated when my dad would come to my sporting events, because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him. One time I was running from one base to another, feeling exhilaration because *I'd done it*. *I'd hit a home run*. The smile died on my face when I heard my dad yell, ""Run with your feet straight! You look stupid!""

As a teen, my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone. He was never physically abusive, but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you. 

When I was 15, he was almost successful. I went through a couple of really bad months. A friend died, my dog died, we moved, and my mental health was tanking. A week after my friend died (car accident), my dad asked, ""So when are you going to get over it?"" It took me by surprise, because at that time, I wasn't crying or acting out. I was just sitting there, eating dinner with the family. My mom immediately reacted, gasping out a surprised, ""John!"" and the two of them began fighting again, over my dad's need to mess with me. I sat there, head down on the table, thinking, *I'm not allowed to be sad. I'm not allowed to feel happy. I can't get mad. I'm in pain, and he finds it annoying. Just leave me alone, dad. Leave me alone.*

That's when it clicked: my dad, for whatever reason, seemed to hate me. I could try to make him like me, but it wasn't going to work. As I got older, my goal became to avoid him, his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully. We were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship

That's when it clicked: it's not me, it's him. My sisters could like and love him, but I didn't need to respect him. I was done trying to please him, trying to do the right things, trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want.

Fast forward almost ten years later. After the birth of my son, my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me, because for whatever reason, he latched on to my kid. For the sake of my kid, I let my dad have a relationship with him, but I was always monitoring, waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him. There was no way I was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me. 

Fortunately, my dad died before the change could happen. I sat in the back at his funeral, dry eyed and satisfied. Of course my sisters were upset. They had good relationships. But for me and my mom, it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead. No more stress. No more unreasonable expectations. The egg shells we'd been walking on were swept away, and we could be content. 

I have an uncle in West Virginia that I started to see as my father-figure. At first, I jokingly would call him dad, testing the waters, waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids, and doesn't need an adopted daughter. I go see him once a year. But I always felt like maybe, he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying. 

A couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he was coming up for Christmas. He said he couldn't. 

But then he said, ""I love you, my daughter.""

I was the only kid in my family to go to college. I'm from Ireland, so it wasn't a financial decision, I was just the only one who worked hard enough in school to have any chance. In my final two years of school I was studying every day, even during summer and winter holidays, from day 1. My other two siblings were at best, showing up for school, except one of them rarely did, and the other showed up high most of the time. 

This was basically the way it went for my entire life, and during that time my parents had focused their attention on the ""problem children"", completely ignoring my needs wants or achievements. I was left alone to do my homework, or expected to help siblings with homework, even though one of them was older than me and was tackling coursework I hadn't even encountered yet. They weren't abusive parents, just bad ones - if my brother or sister got straight C's, we'd go out to dinner to celebrate. I scored in the top 5% for math scores in the country twice in a row, the second time I didn't even get a congratulations.

So along comes college, and with it exposure to new ideas. I come out as trans to my parents, which they ignore like most things I say. One sibling goes to work in hotels, and eventually around the world on charitourism, working to save turtles and teach kids English. The other eventually moves out of home, gets a job in a hotel he hates, and barely ever calls. I'm stuck at home (it's not common to move out in Ireland if you don't have to during college), and not able to work due to the high workload in college and the long commute (4 hours a day).

Siblings end up back and forth of our family home, and we start to fight a lot. I'm not working, so I don't understand the real world (bare in mind I'd work 40 hours a week during the summer vacation). I'm not doing well in college anymore, so it's assumed I'm slacking off (I'm still in therapy and on medication for depression brought on by stress and neglect). 

I eventually go to the United States, where I meet my now wife for the first time. We spend a glorious couple of months together before I have to travel home because yet again, I've failed college. I had one class to make up, so I put my future on hold and return to Ireland, safe in the knowledge that at least my sister is still in China.

Except she surprises the whole family by coming home for good three days after I get back. 

To cut an already long story short, I finish college, and am a week away from flying back to my now fiance. We're watching a science documentary together on the television. My sister is starts explaining something about it wrong to the youngest sibling (I now have 3, but they're much younger). I correct her, and she tells me I'm wrong. When I tell her I literally have a science degree, the entire reason I'm home at all, she tells me I didn't ""really"" graduate college because I didn't have to take another exam (I was allowed to make up my grade). 

I lose it. I curse her out for being an awful bitch who talks down to everyone at every available opportunity, who hasn't held a real job for 3 years and barely limped her out of high school. I yell at my Dad for enabling her shit for so many years, allowing her to walk over family members because she's loud. My mother asks me what's wrong, and I tell her she's raised a hateful, spiteful daughter. 

I spend the next week at a friends house before travelling home and packing up my things to load onto the airplane. The night before, my mother tells me she'll get up in the morning to wish my goodbye and goodluck as I start my new life in America.

She didn't.

It's not about me, it's about someone I used to know.

_______________

Growing up, I was part of a huge diverse friend group. People from different schools, different small towns. All walks of life. Something I feel really fortunate for. One of these guys, let's call him Big Bob, was part of our group for years and years. He came from a tough family, never had any money, but honestly, he brought the ""energy"" to the party. One of those guys. Always talking, bombastic, good with jokes and memes and references. So collectively, those of us who had the means found a way to help him along since we did enjoy his company. And this worked for YEARS. We'd drive him home, help sneak him into the movie theater, share food and alcohol  with him. 

However... As he got older, he started to develop sticky fingers. At first it was candy bars at the cash register. Then it was a odd piece of clothing from a store he'd stuff down his shorts. Then it was portable harddrives in the Best Buy bathroom. Eventually he got caught by the law, which seemed to stifle things... for a minute. 

But then he moved to doing things where the law wouldn't catch up to him. You'd find games wouldn't be returned in a timely manner... Then eventually we found out he had sold an old xbox & games that someone had ""loaned"" him after they bought the new xbox 360. We wanted to have a big LAN party and wanted another system... and that's how we found out that he had sold it for petty cash. He never told anybody. 

This continued. Little things would just go missing. Again, and again, and again. Eventually, I went off to college and he didn't... but those who also didn't go to college you would still hear stories from. Eventually it reached a boiling point and one of the friends in the group confronted Big Bob, one who had been stolen from. Bob denied it all to his face. And we ostracized him. 

I know he was in that place. He had a bit of a temper, and I've seen him lose it before and smash his phone on the concrete. I know for a fact he felt like burning the house down after that confrontation night. Nothing actually ever happened, but growing up with him for 10 years I'm sure it was a whirlwind that night.

But at the end of the day... it was deserved. We tried to make him part of the village. Or at least I hope I did.",lowstrife,595,2020-01-04 05:35:11

I was a young teen when I was first admitted. The staff were extremely abusive to most patients, although certain ones were spared due to their meek behavior. One time, I was tricked into admitting to an infraction that I had never committed, and I was forced to stay in my room for several days on end. I attempted to file a complaint, but it never really went anywhere. The staff were typically very unkind, and they treated each patient as though they were a burden. I was very lonely, and I sank even deeper into depression. I kept my head down for several months until I was eventually released.

I struggle with feeling worthwhile, and I criticize myself for the smallest things because the hospital conditioned me into nitpicking and punishing myself for not being perfect.

The straps anchored him firmly in place, they were uncomfortable but necessary. The engine burst to life with a roar that burned out all the other audio, the vibrations tore through his body and he felt his body sink back into the seat as the G-Force began to take hold.

The captain was watching the readouts on the LED displays and monitoring their trajectory as the acceleration began to peel his thoughts away, there was no more room in his brain, it had been filled by pure fear. The boosters grew with greater ferocity as they lifted higher into the sky, the sun beaming down on the left side of the shuttle.

But faster they went.

Through max Q and higher into the stratosphere until the engines grew quieter, the air more silent, and the vibrations became less violent. They were approaching space, the final frontier.

An hour later, and with the path of the shuttle a success he noticed as his raw emotions withdrew that his body felt funny, head hair drifted aimlessly across his eyes as the captains pen hovered in mid air and he knew the impossible was true, his childhood dream, he was in space. Weightless.

The captain turned around to him, and motioned him to unhook his seatbelts. He did as he was commanded. They both left their chairs and glided over to the tiny glass windows to overlook the magnificence of Earth.

It just didn't make sense to me that he would spend five days on one planet, and make the creation of the trillions of other stuff in the universe a little footnote. I was confronted about this belief a couple times, only one of which wasn't laughed off. That single person who engaged started a serious discussion, presenting much more evidence for the globe earth, and eventually told me to watch Carl Sagan. The Cosmos series was on YouTube, and once I watched it, I had to know more. Finally, a video from the channel MinutePhysics convinced me, in no uncertain terms, that the earth was round. All it took was one quote, which I still remember leaving chills down my spine: ""you should have put a serious tag on this question.""",maleorderbride,4678,2021-01-14 21:00:35

AskReddit,Former Flat Earthers. What made you come round?,kxbzv3,gj9xsrb,"Not a flat earther. But I *was* a 9-11 ""truther"" I guess you could say--insofar as I thought it was an inside job. I was heavily influenced and believed in multiple conspiracies in the Zeitgeist film as well. There was a never ending source of dark, shadowy ""they's and them's"" controlling everything behind the scenes.

I think there were a few factors that helped me escape that:

* Losing my father. It was such a life changing event at that age that it made me reconsider everything in my life. 

* Some light training in evaluating information. I learned about how to vet sources, primary, whether something was actually news or just an opinion/editorial, etc.. Ironically, this education came *before* I was duped. After my dad died, suddenly this started to kick in more.

* Lack of time/means to dig myself a deeper hole. I started college shortly after my father passed and that + a full time job took up all my time. I had none to buy further into the newest crazy bullshit. I had no Facebook/Twitter/IG/etc.. No smart phone or texting. My primary use of Reddit once I discovered it was for r/Naruto, r/Bleach, rage comics, and advice animals. 

So all in all, I think the time away gave me time to detox. If I had been on social media as I discovered those things, I can only imagine I very well may have become a Q believer as well. Looking back I see how gullible I was in that moment, fooled by the onslaught of half truths and clever ""logic"" of the various theories. I know better now (and I should have known better then), but I've been humbled to the fact that everyone is vulnerable to this sort of stuff.

These same people are 9/11 truthers, Holocaust deniers, and anti-vaxxers and they connect these conspiracies together.

As Dan from the channel Folding Ideas puts it in his excellent video [In Search Of A Flat Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44):

> Nominally, Flat Earth is a belief that the Earth isn't a globe, but is actually flat, a fact that has been kept from Us, meaning normal people, by a nebulous, powerful Them for nefarious, inscrutable purposes. ... I think it's worth considering that the shape of the Earth might actually be the least important belief of Flat Earth. Flat Earth is a syncretic, biblical belief that is both evangelical and apocalyptic. ... The world is flat and They are hiding that fact from you because a flat Earth would be irrefutable proof that we live in a divine fishbowl and, thus, that God is real.

> Flat Earthers are not otherwise empty vessels who believe one kooky thing. They believe that thing because it suits their purposes. Flat Earthers have an agenda. ... Their anxiety is that the world has become too complex, that too many things are changing, and that science and progressivism are actively malicious elements working to obstruct the true nature of God.  Most people don't actually believe Flat Earth because they were persuaded by shoddy evidence... they do so because it says something they already believe about the nature of the social world.",Didgeridoox,598,2021-01-14 22:08:16

I looked up to him and wanted to be like him. He’d take the fall for me when I did something that would cause my dad to punish me. I remember that morning vividly. I got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked. I kept coming back but he wouldn’t answer the door. My parents weren’t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that. When it was time for bed I told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again. After my brother didn’t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling. I wish I didn’t see that. I screamed the entire time and wouldn’t left go of his hand. It felt cold and my mother had to peel me away. He left a suicide note and a hand written will. He left me his favourite book. I miss you Jeff. 

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for the love. 

Edit 2: My dad kept repeating “why Jeffery? Why? and tried to get him down from the fan. I was screaming PLEASE JEFF! and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn’t separate our hands she pulled me away. She was crying so hard. I remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming “you should have opened his door for me”

Edit 3: The book is Animal farm by George Orwell. I always carry it with me now. Whenever he’d read it to me I’d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we’d laugh. 

There wasn’t much in his will. He left me the book and his game boy. He left my mom his wrist watch. My dad didn’t get anything in the will. 

Edit 4: Wow I woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love. Thank you for all your kind words. I’ve never spoken about the details before and I pray this helps someone who is struggling. To all the Jeff’s, I know it’s hard but please be strong. You don’t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering. It’s the most painful thing ever. For years I had nightmares of trying to save him but each time I’d get there too late. 

In his note he said he was really sorry and didn’t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn’t bear the pain anymore. He said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world. He told my mom he loved her and hoped she’d find the courage he didn’t have.

They bought me my favorite foods, watched Ru Paul’s Drag Race with me for weeks (seriously.. for some reason it was the only thing I could watch.) They listened to me cry and didn’t try to give me solutions. They just said “I know”. We had a code word- potato.

There was always a plan for the next day- “Tomorrow we’re going to have lunch at that Mexican place, ok?” “Tomorrow let’s look for a special garden marker for Miles.” I think that was a big part of it- having a plan for the next day meant I had to keep going.

Just saw this elsewhere on the internet in reference to recent events. For obvious reasons (at least, for anyone who has had to listen to me bitch about how much I hate winter), it really resonated with me...

When you have depression it’s like it snows every day.

Some days it’s only a couple of inches. It’s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend’s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home.  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole.

Some days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shoveling. You leave early because it’s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.

Some days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed. By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. You don’t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. Plus they don’t get this much snow at their house so they don’t understand why you’re still stuck at home. They just think you’re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.

Some weeks it’s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it’s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It’s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won’t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven’t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You’re too cold to do anything except sleep.

Sometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it’s death to stay here, but it’s death to go out there too.

The thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don’t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn’t care, it’s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.

Also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can’t shovel, sometimes places you can’t even see. Maybe it’s on the roof. Maybe it’s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there’s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbors say it’s a shame and they can’t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.

-

I don’t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade. It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could’ve been the long, slow winter. Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling. Maybe they weren’t. Sometimes, shoveling isn’t enough anyway. It’s hard to tell from the outside, but it’s important to understand what it’s like from the inside.

I firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action. It’s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it’s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis. I’m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck. I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that’s why people pull away.

I don’t have a message for people with depression like “keep shoveling."" It’s asinine.  Of course you’re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can’t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are. My message is to everyone else. Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor. Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood. Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak.  

Depression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow. And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm. But like climate change, that doesn’t mean we are helpless. If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level.

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c1yoz,"Bourdain's death really bothers me for a specific reason. I think,  like many people my age, I struggle with trying to find a vocation that  gives me happiness. We're Millennials, and we were raised with the idea  that we could do whatever we wanted. So when reality hit like a truck,  and we found ourselves working the same boring job that 99&#37; of us were  going to get, we found ourselves perpetually unsatisfied with our lives.  That's why so many of us struggle with depression.

What  I hear often is that the true way to happiness is to explore the world,  to see culture, to meet people, and to grow that way as a person. 

 That was literally Anthony Bourdain's job. He got paid millions to  travel the world, to see culture, to meet people, and to grow. And he  killed himself.

I feel very proud to say that this week has been my first week in years that I can say I’ve been genuinely happy and proud of myself.

It gets better. It genuinely does. Even when you’re in the deepest hole. But you can’t do it alone. You can’t just cover over your issues. You need to destroy them.

In Canada, you can get referred to therapists for free by your family doctor. It takes a long time, but the wait is worth it. In the meantime, tell your friends. If they’re your true friends, they’ll understand. And, if you’re like me, you’ll find out that they’re going through the same thing.

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c7hf8,"I bought a dog. 

I have a very busy life, so people ask me if I regret having her, since dogs are all high maintenance. I need to walk her a few times a day, feed her, keep her entertained, clean up after her, remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers. 

I don't regret it. I got her for one purpose that I won't tell them. Because I'm lonely. Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts. I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her. 

I left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week. I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come. For the first time in years, I just cried. I missed her. I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves. Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day. But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health. 

I recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support. I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog. I'm glad I did. I had one friend tell me to ""absolutely not take the job""; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge. I can't say he would be wrong. 

I used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to. And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me. I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty. I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax. 

Now, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying. Things are starting to look better.

They just do not know what else to do. 

Some are truly devastatingly depressed or mentally ill. But this is not uniformly true. Many many people who are suicidal are genuinely not ""mentally ill."" 

Speaking of myself a long time ago now and others I have known - there are people out there whose suicidal ideation is a ""logical"" analytic response to essentially impossible life pressures and situations and - right or wrong - it can feel very hurtful, even offensive, and unhelpful to tell them their thinking is clouded. 

I and others I have known used the same basically functional working (but very very stressed) analytic mind to **choose* not to commit suicide.  

As I moved through that place and eventually out of it, I had to hold onto the ""option"" in my mind and make the choice -- albeit increasingly more easily -- many times before it was gone. 

All that and this too - please don't turn people into messages or PSAs. Suicide is absolutely horrible - I have been affected by its aftermath more times than I care to share, very directly and less intimately as well.

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c4cg1,"I tried to kill myself at the end of May of this year. I felt like I hit rock bottom, and at the time it seemed like the only way out. I lost the woman I loved, I started drinking everyday, I hurt a lot of people emotionally. I thought that if I pushed everyone away, it would be easier to let go. I’m not comfortable saying how I did it, but when I regained consciousness I called a friend who helped me. I’m so glad that I wasn’t successful. When I was a young child, my mom and I walked in on my brother unconscious after a hanging and it’s an image that is seared into my brain. Thankfully he survived, but I’ll never forget my mom’s screams of agony, and her pleading with God when she was trying to get him to wake up. The thought of her having to go through that again, ensures that I will never attempt it anymore. Instead of wishing to die in my sleep, I’m so thankful for every day that I wake up. Because every day, is a fresh start.

And to the kind stranger on here who has talked to me and helped me, if you ever read this, thank you so much. You have helped more than you’ll ever know. ",throwawayjklol1323,713,2018-06-08 16:50:59

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c3ajr,"I got a dog here. If I didn't come home one day, he'd never stop sitting by the door waiting for me. He'd never stop missing my smell and my voice. He'd never stop wishing for one more walk, one more game of chasing the laser with me, one more high-five for a treat. He'd never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk, and letting his heart be filled with a moment's joyful hope. No matter how many times that hope was dashed, he'd never let go of it. He's kind of a doofus that way.

Anybody else in my life might eventually get over it. You can explain to them what happened and they'd at least be able to understand if not accept it. But my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why I didn't come home. And he's had a hard enough life so far. I was his only friend when he had nobody, and he was mine.

No matter what I'm going through in life, putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do. Otherwise, I probably would have done it already. 

Life is random. There's no fate. There's no karma. ""The Secret"" doesn't actually work, except for making the people who wrote those books rich. There's no magic Santa Claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished. Maybe God exists, but he sure doesn't interfere. I've been praying for decades for some sort of help, or at least guidance so I can help myself. No response. No answers either. For example, why did a loving God let such an abusive monster come into my mom's life when I was a kid, turning me into an emotional cripple who can't deal with any sort of stress without crumbling? Why does child abuse happen every single day in this world? No response.

So a sane person can only conclude that it's all just random. 

That can be scary. But it can also be liberating. It means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point. It can't all be bad forever. That breaks the laws of the universe. At some point something randomly good will happen. The scales will eventually balance. There's no intelligence behind it. It's just chaos that's part good and part bad. Accept it. Fighting it won't change anything.

One thing's for sure, though. Those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them. Sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism. Prepare for emergencies so that they don't destroy you, and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come. But overall, just wait and watch, knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever, but neither can anything be bad forever. ",thudly,635,2018-06-08 16:36:11

I'm manic depressive and am used to the ups and downs, but this low didn't go away. I thought I was stronger than my depression but it just kept going. After about 6 months my spouse was just barely able to hang in there and was spending a lot of time at her mother's in another town because I was just such a fucking asshole and was losing myself. Christmas night that year, wife was at her family's celebration, I sat in our guest bedroom alone and had my 9mm in my hand. I struggled and was crying and angry and a fucking nightmare was unfolding in my head. I couldn't do it though. I let my dog in and be jumped on me and was licking me and wagging his tail, so I hung out with him for a while and put the gun away. I promised my wife I would try to make the changes necessary to recover and fast forward to today, we're halfway through her pregnancy with our first! It's a boy! I'm very physically active and I have things to work towards, and now a son coming that deserves a great set of parents. My wife is incredible and she stuck with me through times where I would have left myself... She did what she could when she could, considering how much I was pushing everyone away during that time. I can never repay her for being loyal to me when I don't think I deserved loyalty, I just hope I can give her and my son the best husband and dad possible for the rest of our lives. 

Edit: at the time, I was planning to make everyone hate me so no one would miss me when I finally killed myself. It was a dark pattern that made me lose who I was. I am a different person today and I have learned to recognize the signs and not ignore my ""small lows"". I never miss a chance to tell my wife how wonderful she is.

I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem. More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side.

Again, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind.

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c385b,"Please don't use the saying ""It's a permanent solution to a temerapy problem.

This might be true for someone who suffers from situational depression. The depression that goes away.

For someone with chronic depression it never truly goes away. It is not a temporary problem. It can be managed. You can be better. You can learn to live almost normally. 

But when a person has been suffering for years, barely living, barely able to get out of bed most morning, it's not a temporary problem.

When I was in my worst depressed state and I heard that saying for the first time, what I heard was: ""It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem"" And you know what? That was comforting. It was encouraging in the wrong way. I wanted to just cease to exist. Not have to worry about waking up the next morning. 

What got me through was knowing that I would destroy my children's lives. I knew they would blame themselves. Even if I thought they were better off without me there and that I was damaging them. If I took my life it would be much worse for them.

I started therapy. And that was the hardest thing I have ever done. Just finding a therapist was way harder than it should have been. I decided to show my kids that even though I was damaged and broken I could be strong.

I started being selfish in a good way. I started taking care of myself. If I couldn't get out of bed one day I didn't. I only did the bare minimum of what needed to be done. I dropped the kids off at school and came home and slept or just watched tv. I picked up the kids from school and ordered pizza.

But I only gave myself one day. My therapist called it my isolation day. The next morning I got up. I set goals for my self. One a week. Something simple. When I accomplished that goal I celebrated. Then set a new one for the next week.

My first goal was just going to the hardware store and picking out the paint for a furniture refab I wanted to do. When I say my therapist next I showed her a picture of my finished project. She was so proud of me she hugged me.

It's been a long hard journey and it will never end but I have learned to find joy in my life. I will never be cured and I will always have bad episodes but that's ok. I know they will end and I can get back to living.

There's an organization called ""Always keep fighting"" I've chosen to live by those words. When things are bad I take a sharpie and under my watch band write the letters AKF. I can just look at it remember that I am strong and I can get through this.",fuckthisiwantwhiskey,399,2018-06-08 16:35:14

Don’t be harsh with your loved ones when they’re struggling

Don’t negate sadness or depression, their struggle is real, despite your inability to experience it

Listen

Be open, be vulnerable 

See the clues. My dad never said “I’m hurting” but he did exhibit signs

Don’t judge

Don’t try to fix. This is a struggle that can’t be fixed by logic, by words, by an external force. This person needs to WANT to change, internally - and there’s no “magic solution” like a job, money, or relationship that can do it. All you can do it listen, empathize, and love. Be there. Don’t hide from the unpleasantness that is depression, face it with your loved one who struggles. Let them know their pain is your pain, and you are in this together.

At this point in his life he was just about to finish his  degree in Industrial Design. He had a girlfriend from Spain and life in general looked promising.

However I guess he felt anxiety about his girlfriend leaving back for her home country, him ending one life segment and entering a new one.

He jumped of his Balcony located on the 8th floor.

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0cbn5l,"I don't talk about suicide much, because it is a very painful subject for me... perhaps, in part, because the shadow of it stalks me sometimes, waiting to catch me when I'm down.

But 11 years ago, I was desperate enough to believe that everyone who knew me would be better off without me. I believed that the scales weighed heavily against me - that I caused more harm than good - and that if I simply didn't exist, it would make things better for everyone.

So I started counting my pills. I'd been seeking treatment for depression for five months, but nothing was working. The meds made me worse, or they made me so apathetic that I found no joy in life, or they gave me such bad side effects that I could barely stay lucid. I thought there was no way out. So I was counting my pills, trying to figure out how many would cause an overdose so I could take them, lie down in bed, and die.

I'd arranged them all nicely, counted out every single one. I'd positioned my glass of water next to them all, and I stood staring at the scene, feeling *so* overwhelmed because the intensity and duration of my suffering had been so drawn out, and it just wasn't getting better. It had been years. *Years*. A slow decline until a breakdown, and then I was in so deep I couldn't see a way out.

Then the phone rang. It was a friend of mine, a Catholic priest, who said he felt moved to call me and see how I was doing in case things were bad. I lied to him; I told him that I was fine, that I was receiving treatment and that I was hopeful that things would start looking up. But I didn't think I had any fight left in me. He told me that he believed I did, and that he hoped I could hang on awhile longer.

I hung up the phone and burst into tears - ugly, inconsolable crying, snot dripping out my nose, curled up in a ball. But my friend had planted a seed of hope. *Someone* believed in me, even if I couldn't. And I guess I felt that I owed it to him - and to my family - to try.

I managed to get an appointment at the emergency psychiatry clinic awhile later, and there I met the psychiatrist who prescribed the drug that saved my life. I got into a daily outpatient program at the hospital. I met other people who were like me, and I found myself believing in them - believing that they could fight, that they could get better, even though I didn't believe I could. Somehow, they said they believed in me, too. And so for a second time, I saw that other people believed in me, even if I didn't. And I felt again that I should try.

So I tried. I got into weekly therapy with a psychiatrist, and I was in her care for seven years. She adjusted my meds as needed and we began the long, arduous process of untangling the mess that was my mind. She never gave up on me. (I'm in a country where she doesn't make money off me. She gets a flat salary.) 

Now, it's 11 years later, and things *have* gotten better. I am better now than I ever have been. It took awhile after my rock bottom moment to find that spark of hope within myself, but I did find it, and that is what kept me going. It made me look for anything I could to keep me hanging on, and even now, it's the small things in life that keep me here. When the moon shines through my window at night and pools on my pillow. When the white blossoms on that weird bush in the backyard finally bloom for one week every year, and I can smell them on the wind. When my dog wakes up in the morning and comes to get me because he is happy I am awake. When the sun shines just right, or the wind sends petals filtering down through the trees, or the world is silent and glittery after a fresh snowfall.

I find those moments, and I ""keep"" them. I commit them to memory so that when things get bad again, I can remember what I love about this life, and remind myself to keep hanging on. 

I still get low.Two years ago, I had been fired from my job and was certain I would never become a fully functional adult and I would always have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in society. I stood on a subway platform and listened to the rattle of the trains and tried to convince myself not to jump. The tracks were hypnotising, almost. I looked up and found myself staring at a poster for suicide prevention, and the irony was not lost on me. It broke the trance. I stepped back from the yellow line and went home. I stayed.

Last month, I got slapped in the face with a bout of severe depression out of nowhere, and then my dog passed away, which made it worse. (Dogs immensely improve my mental health.) But I stayed.

You can stay, too. 

Take it day by day. For those of us with severe mental health issues, that's all we can do - take it day by day, see how we feel, see if there are any little joys we can find and savour them. You have to cultivate the ability to find them, and it might not be easy at first. (I'm a stubborn ass and was originally so intent on believing that there was nothing good in the world that it took me a couple years to learn how to look closer.) But eventually, you'll have a breakthrough. Maybe you'll see a toddler get pegged by a ball and you'll fall over laughing. Maybe you'll hear the cicadas buzz in the heat of August and remember how awesome summers felt as a kid. Maybe you'll find an indie game on Steam that has a really compelling story and you'll find that you can't WAIT to get back to it and find out what happens next. You never know.

But you can stay. Just take it day by day. And you can see what happens.

That’s when I realized I was being delusional, no one coming to my funeral would be having a good time. They would all be miserable. The note wouldn’t explain it well enough, no matter how many times I rewrote it in my head I couldn’t get it so that people would understand. My mother, she would never understand, ever. 

So, I thought about it. Most of the shit I’m worried about, it’s just shit I’m worried about. If I just stopped caring about it, it would no longer be shit I’m worried about. I mean killing myself is the end, There is nothing worse that can happen to you at that point, the game is over. Maybe I just needed to start a new game, one where I was free from the shit holding me down in this one. 

I decided I would try one more time. I’ve already lost this life. I’m here, about to kill myself tomorrow, I’ve lost, but I can start a new game, one more fucking try. This way I can restart my life without ruining the lives of others. I mean me taking my life would ruin the lives of so many around me. I can’t do that, I just want to end mine. 

So I did, I ended it by deciding to try again cause fuck it, what worse thing could I do that I haven’t already done? The only thing is kill myself, so if I don’t do that, this new life will be better than the last one. I decided to play the game, one more time. 

Since then I still think about suicide, but not multiple times a day. I don’t harp on it and dream everyone would be better off without me, cause they wouldn’t. My parents would be crushed. My siblings would be crushed. I would have traded my broken ass self for breaking a piece in each of them. 

So anyway, one more time, can’t hurt any more than it did this time right? One more time, and if I fuck up this one, it will probably be one more time again. ",Maxnelin,203,2018-06-08 16:35:51

My question might be better if I asked, are there instances where suicide can be executed by persons with  sound mind, who take proper steps to ensure their affairs are in order, their loved ones are accounted for, and who simply want to make the choice about the manner, timing, and setting of their death?

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0cbv13,"Man. This is not a good thread to read through if you're struggling with suicidal ideation. 

The...temptation of suicide is ever present once it's blossomed, I think. The idea abates but lingers, biding its time. You can still have so many things to be happy for, so many things to be Pollyanna-GLAD about, and still, the sticky sweet singsong of, ""but you could be done. You could be over it and not struggling any more. You could REST."" chirps persistently in your ear. 

Many times friends say, ""come, talk to me when you feel this way."" Therapists ask you to be open with them - ""are you feeling suicidal right now?"" At first, you want to trust them. But - almost always - with friends, you end up having to reassure THEM that you aren't going to ACTUALLY go through with it. The emotional toll of reassuring someone else when you are already feeling drained and fragile is a lodestone around the neck, cement shoes on a river during the first freeze. And therapists, bless their hearts (and I do mean that in the very Southernist way I can manage), tend to react and report you rather than listening. 

Say you end up in the hospital because you chose to check yourself in instead of follow through with your plan. You may also - as low income - end up in a facility with heavy drug users and addicts and other lost little puppies such as yourself, and you'll get so heavily medicated you walk around in an apathetic fog, still struggling to breath in enough air to not die in a way that feels more like murder. Group therapy will become the bane of your existence. ""Here, rip open your wounds in the company of strangers. You're safe here!"" a perky fresh-out-of-college or drained dead-around-the-eyes doctor will say. Nurses chat cherrily with patients. ""Oh, you'll be back! They always are."" 

So you withdraw more. You tuck away the horror you feel at the prospect of trudging through more struggles, bill roulette and day after day, week after week, of trudging through the motions at work. You hide your loneliness,  which at times threatens to overwhelm you with a black tidal wave of nothingness, under a veneer of cheerfulness and compassion and empathy. You learn to make your smile reach your eyes and body language when you want to weep for how much you long to be able to hold out your arms to someone - anyone - and say, ""help me! I just want to belong, to fit in, to have a place that feels like the Home I've read of in the stories."" But you can't, and so you go about your days smiling but still hearing the quiet weeping of a small child tucked into a corner in the back room of your mind. 

And sometimes the weeping abates, and sometimes the beauty and joy around you slip in, like glorious little snapshots in a world full of dark gray. And you feel content. Warm, even. Happiness. And then, not right away, but eventually the crying of the small child is audible again. And you have to play the game of, ""reasons - what reasons do I have to stay. What reasons do I have that prevent me from leaving."" 

Yeah. Suicide can be seen as selfish. You like to think you own a piece of those who you love just as you give pieces of yourself to them to cherish as well. But sometimes - sometimes - on the days and nights when the weeping is the loudest, an inky black ocean of sorrow lapping at your feet as the tide threatens to come up and fully overwhelm you at last, as the storm clouds in your mind darken, and the apathy threatens to steal your very last sliver of breath from your very lips, then yes. I can understand - much better than I ever wished to - why the siren song of suicide could overcome a person, no matter how hard they tried to fight it. 

And hopefully, HOPEFULLY, if you didn't before, you can now too. ",Fyrebarde,166,2018-06-08 18:36:55
AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c2lkw,"I'm not willing to open up on reddit about it, but I am seeing a therapist who seems to care about my wellbeing. I did want to bring up on this topic- why is the media (and reddit, heavily) publicizing the suicide of Avicii, Spade, and Bourdain? It's been shown that when they publicize suicide, suicide rates go up (see [Robin Williams](http://time.com/5137194/robin-williams-suicide-rate/)). ""Everyday people"" don't get this much media attention over it, they usually censor it for a reason. It's almost worse, in that spiraling line of depressed thinking ""This person had all these things, money, fame, love, success, and they still aren't happy- what reason do I have?"" and they may lose a significant amount of hope that things will ever get better, or are even able to get better. I get that those things don't make a person truly happy nor can counteract clinical depression/anxiety/PTSD, but when you get into one of those funks, it's very hard to think clearly. My friend's aunt who has a long history of depression and suicidal ideation was saying almost this exact thing when they were playing Avicii on the news repeatedly, and my friend was so worried she sat outside her door while she took a bath to make sure she was washing in there.

I guess there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it (publicize) but it's really seeming to be saturated currently.",forgotusernamex5,155,2018-06-08 16:26:24

AskReddit,Suicide Prevention Megathread,8pks1u,e0c9677,"I had struggled with mild depression and anxiety for a while, but it was never overwhelming. Then the day after Thanksgiving, 2016, I moved 5 hours away from my family and fiancée to take a job at a tv station.

The town was depressing in and of itself, with some of the highest heroin overdose and poverty rates in the state. Couple that with a shitty work situation and being just 23, I hit rock bottom.

I was keeping it mostly under control, and actually started seeing a therapist who helped quite a bit. But one day came where it was too much, and I was so stressed and broken from the thought of having to go to work and throw myself into a job that was so draining that I decided I was going to drive myself into a tree on the way over. I never self-harmed, I still could laugh and joke with friends, but I simply didn’t see the point of going on any longer.

While I didn’t tell my fiancée, she could tell something was wrong, and called my therapist. My therapist immediately sent someone from the services over, who helped talk me down. She called into my job to tell them I wouldn’t be coming in to work that day. 

That I was thankful for enough, but it was the reactions of those around me that moved me. When he heard what happened, my roommate (who worked at the same station and whom I had only met a few months before) rushed home immediately to make sure I was okay.

That night, my fiancée drove five hours in a snow storm to get to me, and spent a week with me, and got to meet my coworkers.

I ended up leaving the job two months or so later - a year ago since this past Tuesday. I moved back home with my parents for a few months, and now I’m back in the town where I went to college, working as an admissions counselor for my alma mater.

I married my wife last December, and she has been my saving grace. She is lovely, and funny, and smart, and so much more than I can ever hope to be. I entirely credit her with saving my life, and I never can tell her enough how much I love her.

People care about you. You just have to let them in.",nova_mjohnson,155,2018-06-08 17:58:49

Edit: to many comments to reply, to. Thanks for the awards however put it towards charity I have no use for them.

Hobbies alone was a broad statement. Basically the goal is to meet new people. Seek discomfort is a good phrase and a good model presentation of how to meet new people. Google their  YouTube channel.

Hobbies can be good but it's hard to find the small groups that have no internet presence. Volunteering, charity work, etc is more aimed at helping x, while you benefit in socializing. 

My anecdote, others may vary. 
The other fishing, hunting, etc group's come from making connections. Door knocking, leaving letter etc asking for permission and slowly building a blue book of properties to hunt n fish while cleaning up there property in return. Plus you can ask if they want me to take anyone in their family with me or can I bring a person over etc after trust is built. 

Lastly, if anyone reads my handle. It's okay to be alone. I'm alone but not lonely. I have reddit to come socialize with you assholes :). But fr it's okay to only have a hand few friends you connect with. The key aspect of friendship is respect. If they don't respect your time nor you as a person as you do them. They aren't your friend.

AskReddit,How the F do you make friends as an adult if you don't drink?,mdlbrp,gsacu59,"The closest I have gotten to making new friends is through:

&#x200B;

1- My Kids sports - just hanging with the other parents or coaching teams - I don't consider any of them to be FRIENDS, but we enjoy hanging out and shooting the breeze at games, but once sports are over - I'll never see them again, but if I run into them randomly, I'm sure we'll chat for a minute - solid acquaintances.

&#x200B;

2 - Video games - just having a regular group of randoms in a server regularly is nice, I play a racing game and the others are typically all from other countries, but text chat is fun and its at least interaction with people I don't live with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I really wanted FRIENDS - I'd probably have to go back in time and do a better job keeping in touch with my old group of buddies (beyond here is an edit due to ""its never too late to keep in touch reply)...

edit- yes, I agree its usually never too late, but when you LITERALLY don't even know what to say, or talk about with an old friend, who was a very good friend, and you are hoping that you can just talk about THEIR kids sports...I think it is pretty damn late.  But this happens to millions of people, its normal, and I don't dwell, or recommend anyone else dwell on it.  My parents (mid 70s) moved into a 55+ housing community (houses not assisted living) and they've made 'friendly' with neighbors, play cards, 'pop in' for a drink on occasion, so maybe it gets easier later.

&#x200B;

And Im not really 'sad' about not having friends, Im a bit 'to myself' and enjoy short earnest conversations with the many people I've gotten to know.",BurnDownTheSides,9025,2021-03-26 13:10:38

* Work: never eat lunch alone, organise hang outs after work
* Professional networking organisations: nothing bonds more than hating your industry/job together 
* Going out alone & chatting up strangers: woman here & have befriended men who approached me this way, so don’t say this won’t work for men. You just have to genuinely want to be friends instead of being a creeper. If you have kids & they have kids, they’ll WANT to be friends
* Reddit: if someone in a niche subreddit you’re into happens to mention they live in your city, just go, “Hey! I live there too! Want to meet up?” The more niche the sub, the higher chance of making friends
* Random fun classes/activities: if you’re both into it, you probably will click
* Online dating: surprisingly made many good friends of this. Of course some were with benefits.  
* New mom groups: everyone is depressed to a certain degree, sleep deprived & desperate for support

&#x200B;

I've made friends through work and through hobbies - I love taking fun classes.  I like taking dance classes mostly and when you're going to the same class week in, week out, you get talking to the other people at the class and friendships can blossom.

&#x200B;

You can be friendly and smiley and strike up a bit of conversation and from that you build up a bit of rapport.  I made friends by asking a couple of the girls if they'd like to grab a coffee after class and then it became a weekly ""thing"", coffee after class.

&#x200B;

It doesn't have to be dance - any kind of class works, even if it's an educational one.  Evening classes are a GREAT place to make new friends.

&#x200B;

Then - and I know everyone's workplace is different, certainly mine is very easy to make friends - through work you can make some nice friends.  Sit with people at lunch hour instead of eating at your desk or in your car - chat to people during the work day and find out things about them - if they have a family, if THEY have any hobbies etc.  Then, when you build up a bit of friendliness ask them if they'd like to go for lunch or (yes I know, AGAIN!) a coffee after work and so forth.

I’m in my thirties. I do drink. My wife doesn’t. Here’s the thing in your thirties. Y’all go to a brewery or some such (well not so much lately) and the whole group will always have a few people not drinking for any or all of the following reasons:
-driving
-pregnant
-on a prescription that makes it inadvisable 
-don’t feel like it
-don’t like what’s available
-the flesh drinks only blood

And generally no one cares if they’re a mature group worth hanging out with. 

Heres the question to ask: do you mean that you only want to hang out in situations where people aren’t drinking? That’s a different thing and a bit more limiting.

But seriously: mature adults deal with all sorts of reasons people won’t drink. This isn’t college. No one thinks your coolness is derived from crushing Miller lites.

* You meet a lot of people. Whether in your own club, competitions, BJJ camps. Any relatively big city should have a BJJ gym, so you can meet people anywhere.
 
* It keeps you fit. Each training session involves sparring and it is similar to a HIIT workout (although you still see lots of examples of typical dad bod veterans who will destroy you). 

* You join a community which you can be a part of for life. It's like a church with traditions, but where everyone is trying to choke each other in stylish pajamas.  

* It's great for the mind. BJJ gives you confidence, but at the same time it is a good ego-killer, and it seriously teaches discipline, consistency, comradery, and for some, it's also a good outlet 2-3x times a week. 

* You learn some actual self-defense. Jiu-Jitsu is one of the main martial arts in MMA. It revolves around grappling and taking people to the ground, where striking becomes way less effective. Of course, it's not going to save your ass from a group fight or someone with a knife, but it helps.

They usually ask good questions and are well equipped to have an informed discussion about their diagnosis and treatment.  Sometimes it's hard for me to dial back my ""patient talk"" where I simplify medical terms for laypeople.  Sometimes it's challenging if their area of expertise is totally unrelated to the issue at hand and they don't recognize their limited understanding.

The worst patients are those who have just a little medical knowledge and think they know everything.  Some version of: ""My aunt is a nurse, and she said a need a whole body MRI for this runny nose...""

I thought I might have a ganglion cyst in my wrist because I could feel something inside that was causing pain when I moved my wrist so I scheduled an appt with a orthopedic surgeon/hand specialist. I had my husband come along (interventional radiologist) in case there were questions I wouldn’t have thought of asking or something I needed more explanation on later. 

The ortho/hand surgeon was friendly and used layman terms with me but technical jargon with my husband. It was funny to hear the switch between “your wrist bones/tendons” and “blah blah anterior blah blah medial blah” whatever he said to my husband.

At one point they did an ultrasound on my wrist to determine if it might be a cyst or if I should get a more detailed MRI, and the surgeon asked my husband if he wanted to take over the ultrasound (since my husband trained in diagnostic radiology as well) and he totally did! Weird to have your husband moving the ultrasound wand and pointing to random blobs of static. They both agreed it was a cyst, even though it looked like a whole lot of static and nothingness to me. So it was interesting to see my husband defer to the surgeon for his specialty and vice versa!

Edit:
Just remembered that time we took our cat in for an X-ray because she was developing arthritis and we weren’t sure how severe it was or if her bones were deteriorating. My husband actually took her X-ray in and had an attending in radiology read it and they were both convinced our cat had bone spurs or little bone growths around her spine near her hip. He was about 80% convinced that our cat’s spine was absolutely wrecked. The vet wasn’t worried and said that cat bones just look like that and it wasn’t hurting her and was nothing to worry about. He ended up doing some research on feline anatomy to make sure our (very knowledgeable) vet wasn’t just talking out of her ass. She wasn’t.

Anyway, moral of the story is that he went to med school to study human anatomy, not feline anatomy, so he had to learn to take a step back and defer to the expert. 😄",jadetaia,558,2020-11-19 19:40:42

It can be weirdly stressful to be the doctor or the patient in this kind of interaction. I’ve learned to not let it bother me when I am the doctor seeing other doctors.

Like someone else said, if I'm seeing a specialist of a particular field then I'm unlikely to have anywhere near as much knowledge as them so I would consult with them just like any other patient.

I might throw in an opinion on what I think, but ultimately I try to shut up and respect that they are a professional and not tell them how to do their job. It's hard to be objective, too, when the patient is yourself or a family member - having someone give their unbiased opinion is often more useful than self-diagnosing, or at least might add some more knowledge or insight that you may not have yourself.",innernorthwannabe,178,2020-11-19 18:43:03

The Rad Onc, for example, thinks and speak differently than the Ortho Surgeon, and I felt like my treatment of each of them was really quite similar to treating a professor of engineering.

IT'S AWFUL.

I've been in as a med student where during the examination I was taught and quizzed about what I thought the problem was (😭)

And now 2 years post qualification I still hate it. In training you tend to move around a lot which means little to no continuity with your own healthcare - so I've tried a few approaches.

Sometimes I don't say I'm a doctor at all unless I'm specifically asked, and I just give them a really really obvious textbook history as to what's going on so that they can't misdiagnose me.

Other times I've done this and they've not done what I was after, so we got into an awkward argument and had to get the national guidelines up from the Internet. 

Now that I've settled a little my doctor knows me, and generally will let me tell them what bloods etc I want, or the diagnosis if I have an idea. Then we'll agree on what to prescribe or future management which is amazing.

There's a few differences. Most notably, access. If I want to see a subspecialist, I text or call them and I'm in their clinic the next morning. No waiting, no referral, usually not billed and often not even documented. If I have questions after the appointment, I usually send them a text and get an answer pretty quickly. When I see other docs as patients, they generally get in much quicker and have much more access to followup and direct communication than other nonphysician patients.

In the actual visit things are different. I generally know the format docs like to hear info in, so tend to ""present"" my case in that format. Things generally move a lot quicker. Because I have at least some knowledge going in, generally the treating doc asks me for my opinion.

Another aspect is sometimes we don't get ""standard of care"", both for good and bad. An example I had is when I had a surgery a couple years back, the standard would have been to wait it out and see if things improved naturally. Instead, I got an MRI that day was in the OR in a matter of hours. I also didn't follow the typical rehab protocol such as physical therapy, because based on my field I already was equipped to provide my own therapy.

Its strange, because you are blending aspects of patient-doctor, professional, and often personal relationships into a single visit. The same doc I am being seen by now probably might have met me for dinner and drinks a week ago.",DoctorKynes,27,2020-11-19 18:25:20

Had co-workers (most of them are my friends) or known associates of co-workers. I usually always know what's wrong with me, I don't know if it's the knowledge or if I just know myself and my body. I'll usually get them for a second opinion or just in case. And in some rare cases, we'd have a disagreement on what the tests and imaging results as. My psychologist (a professor I usually pay him to go into his lecture cause I loves psychology) always thinks I'm wrong with what I think about my mental state, then when another psychologist or even himself tests them, I usually get the win.


During my brain tumour and parkinson's


I recently got diagnosed with parkinson's likely due to the tumor (malignant) in my noggin. I didn't know it but it was obvious. I had a bad short term memory, my hands had tremors, I had severe insomnia to the point I couldn't sleep for days straight and then only to get a few hours in, I was really fatigued and felt like I was carrying myself like a corpse. I felt anxious and had a lot of panic attacks. I felt physically depressed. My ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis on the spine) felt worse. I got an MRI and the results came in. The neurosurgeon in my hospital was I considered friend and we kinda got closer before the planned surgery.


After surgery, turned out to be worse. My existing symptoms were less there but I had new stuff. I stuttered like Jimmy from South Park. I can't read easily when the stuff is close. I couldn't use my legs since I have little sensations on them, I kept on pausing and I had a severely noticeable bad reaction time. Seeing my co-workers treat me as a patient is a bit sad for me.",None,25,2020-11-19 19:09:44
AskReddit,"Doctors of reddit, what’s it like when you go in for a doctors appointment? Do you and your doctor discuss what’s wrong with you like it’s a group project? Do you not go at all because you’re your own doctor?",jx6m5s,gcvcmnv,"Most doctors I know (myself included) say that doctors are the “worst patients”, and I think the reason for that is three-fold:

1.	We are usually VERY resistant to actually go to the doctor, I mean, why should I, I know what he’s going to say and I know what I need to do, I’m not wasting my time (which is absolutely untrue, we can’t know everything and, when it comes to our own health, we’re usually dismissive and don’t pay much attention to it, and most of the time we’re just too “busy” and/or scared to actually go and find out something we don’t want to - which is actually one of the hallmarks of a difficult patient)
2.	When we DO go to the doctor (at least in my experience) we, more often than not, already thought about our own diagnosis and the treatment we need, which forces the other doctor to either go through a sometimes demanding work of changing our mind and do an adequate investigation, as we would suggest to our own patients, or to just accept our self-diagnosis right away and just go on with it to avoid some sort of disagreement (specially if you go to a doctor that already knows you from work or med school - it’s usually wisest to avoid doing that) 
3.	The third reason is actually some sort of consequence of the first two - I’ve seen lots of doctors that only decide to go looking for help when their health problem has reached a very advanced state, usually due to denial, and specially when it’s a mental health issue (which is VERY common around doctors and other health care providers), which potentially makes the actual problem way more difficult to treat, and the patient/doctor themselves way more fragile

So, to sum up, if you’re a doctor and you’re reading this, please remember that you’re still human and that you’re susceptible to all of the diseases you treat every day, and sometimes even MORE susceptible than everyone else - when you became a doctor, you chose a life of helping others, and thus you MUST remember how important it is to reach out for help in the first place...",EuqirnehBR97,24,2020-11-19 21:12:27

In general, most docs have a basic understanding of general medicine and can have a collaborative discussion with their primary doc. When it comes to more nuanced issues involving referrals and consults,  an informed discussion can still be had. One of the most crucial aspects of being a good doctor and surgeon is knowing what you don't know.

I don’t know what the office staff told them that day) The next day we were at MD Anderson.  It was surreal- he presented his own history to the oncologist.

AskReddit,What is the coolest website you’ve visited that no one knows about?,f937om,fipty1r,"Look. this post is old. It's outdated. it's honestly shit. I do not know why I keep getting awards. so listen here fuckers. I no longer condone [playemulator.com](https://playemulator.com). Instead, go to [https://www.retroarch.com/](https://www.retroarch.com/) and download the installer. I'm going to teach you how to play all the games you would have played on playemulator much better on something that doesn't reek. Do not worry about computer specs. my shitty surface pro 5 can run it. it's fine

install retroarch, then open it up and click load cores. It should be the first option you see. Select download a core, then choose a core for the system you want. Wanna play pokemon? grab a GBA core. Mega man? get an NES core. Final fantasy VII? we'll come back to that one

Install the core and you're ready to play a game; but first, you'll need a game! I don't believe I'm allowed to link to it directly, but check out a website called Vimm's lair if you want to accquire some illegal roms the safe way

Download the game files and move them to a cozy safe folder. Don't forget to unzip them! some of them, mainly playstation games, will require 7zip to open. You should really have 7zip anyway so install it if you don't. when your roms are all nice and snug, open up retroarch and scroll down on the left sidebar until you find an option labelled ""import content."" Select ""import from directory"" and select your snugg little rom folder as the directory. Any folders inside that folder will be scanned if they also have game files in them, so keep that in mind! now, if you did that right, you should see your games organised by console underneath the import content option. Now, you can play them! wonder of wonders! hook up a controller or map the buttons to keys on your computer if you hate fun. You can also map hotkeys to speed up or pause the game! woo! if you wanna play ps1 games, you'll need bios; that's basically the playstation's soul! I'll cover that in just a second!

Oh, and if you want to emulate DS games: Don't! Use melonds or dsmume instead! the full versions, not the cores on retroarch! Retroarch has a fit when you emulate a touch screen, and is generally slower when playing ds games!

Since you motherfuckers insist on continually giving me rewards, I'll tell you how to emulate PS1 Games on retroarch. You'll need a core. I like duckstation myself. To make it work you'll need ps1 bios! You can find downloads pretty easily online, but not all of them are safe! If you ever download a .exe file from a site claiming to offer downloads of ROMS or BIOSes delete it quick! Once you've got the ps1 bioses you need (they should be multiple files) you need to find your retroarch folder. It'll be in the folder you installed it to; I installed to my desktop, but if you installed it like a normal person it'll be in your program files folders, which you can get to from ""this pc."" don't touch the system folder, you'll break things. when you've found the retroarch folder, open it up and go to the folder called system. this is different from the system folder I told you not to touch! don't get them mixed up or you'll REALLY break things! put the bios files into the system folder (the one inside the retroarch folder.) That's it! You don't need to do anything else, retroarch automatically takes the bios from that folder when you launch duckstation. Add your ps1 games the way you would any other game, then launch them! I really *really* reccomend a controller to play ps1 games.

Under no circumstances are you to attempt to play n64 games on retroarch. You should use project 64. It's as simple as can be, just download it and open a game and you are playing it. the complicated stuff is the plugins and configuration to make certain games work.

Two more of you FUCKERS gave me awards just now. Fuck you. here's how to emulate ps2 games

PCSX2 is the only emulator you'll want for this. I reccomend the portable version, since it makes it easier to find the folders where you might want to put things. like bios for instance. you still need to give this thing a piece of a real ps2's soul, don't forget. Legally speaking you're meant to steal it from your own ps2 but you won't have trouble finding it online. When you first launch it, it should ask you to select a bios; when you see that window, look inside the PCSX2 folder; you should see a bios folder has been created. Put your bios in there and select it in the window. most downloads will include multiple bioses; this is good! this will allow you to play games from other regions! just select the most updated US bios in the window for now. There's a lot of tweaking and fiddling you can do with PCSX2 to make it run games on potatoes or use the power of super ultra mega gaming pcs to run these 20 year old games in 4K, but as it is now, you should be able to play PS2 games on it, believe it or not.

Three years. It has been three years. how do people keep finding this post. Fuck you. If you want to play modified ROMS such as hacks or translations in retroarch you need to click on import content, click manual scan. Click content directory to find the folder containing your altered rom. Click System Name and choose the console it's for. click file extensions and choose the type of file your game is. Usually it'll be an abbreviated name of the console (GBA, SFC, MD, etc.) If it's a disc-based console like the PS1, you'll want to use the CUE file extension. When you've sorted that out click Star Scan. Now go fuck you'reselves

I have nothing more to teach you my children.  
SO STOP GIVING ME AWARDS.

**The Tutorial is over. Below this point is the old comment, which is what actually got me most of those awards in the first place.**

AskReddit,"If you had the ability to instantly give any person an orgasm, simply by pointing your hand at them like a finger gun and saying “pew”, how would you wield this power?",h9jasg,fux3orr,"I'd probably make a YouTube video that's just a quick 15 seconds of me pointing right at the camera and letting out a rapid fire *pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew* and then post the video Rick Roll style so that anyone thinking they're going to open up a relevant link is treated to an wholly unexpected and more than likely inconvenient orgasm.

Once that catches on, my work is done (although I'll still use my powers for good), and I'm going to enjoy seeing people on trains, in meetings, at events, and wherever on their phones and then suddenly sloshing their shorts because of my Jizz Roll video.

As the years go by, the Jizz Roll will become more and more ubiquitous in society and I'm sure many a folk will take the necessary precautions to splat proof their nether garments with rubber undies or quick release valves. I mean, surely it won't just be the boys constantly creaming their cargos. Surely the ladies will be supersoaking their slizz snugglers and need to wear some manner of sex-grade diaper or possibly just go full skirt and let the drips drops where they may.

Yes, the world at large will be hot and humid with the musk of human sexual excretion. Unlike the Rick Roll, the Jizz Roll will turn into something you want to sit though each and every time and the negative stigma of openly slinging goo or gushing drool will be gone. Thanks to me, the world will be in a near constant state of blissful relief and post-nut clarity. I suspect the world will make huge strides in technological advancements, as well as find unity among races and religions. Civil strife will be a thing of the past when you watch a Jizz Roll and let your stuff blast.

Oh sure, even in my old age, people will want my celebrity for personal hire. Some may call them masochists, but I see these elites rich enough to afford an in person pewing as just regular folk trying to ascend to a sexual nirvana. I'd pin them against the wall, or they would do so themselves as their legs won't be doing them much good for much long, as I relentlessly pew them into oblivion. I'd pew them stupid if that's what they want. I'd pew them until their genitals are tender and throbbing from overuse, bright red like a piece of steel hammered hot by a master blacksmyth. As they sit there, blathering incoherently, giggling and lost on a different plane of conscious existence, I'll shoot 'em one more pew for the road. If they die they die.

That's what I was hired for and that's the power I've been blessed with.",Delicious-Hot-Dog,8589,2020-06-15 17:07:20

Then I'd give her a massage.  Feet first, pew-pew.  Then her shoulders, pew-pew.  Then after that offer her a glass of wine and after we've inevitably drank half a bottle each, we'd move to the bedroom and once she lays down I'd give her a double pew-pew.

The camera tracks a seagull past the ship, through the docks, and to a high rise building where i slip past security with a briefcase. When the elevator door closes, i shed my street clothes and reveal a skin-tight black catsuit. Opening a hatch atop the elevator, I toss up the briefcase and gracefully pull myself through it. As the elevator continues to climb, I put on sunglasses and a ripoff of the mission impossible theme swells.

I sneak through elevator shafts and drop into a penthouse apartment in the top floor overlooking the bay. Thousands of yards below, a security details prepares to bring out the president. 

As he slowly walks up the ramp to the podium, I take aim with my finger gun. Pretending to turn dials and making clicking noises with my mouth. I imagine crosshairs being lowered right on his heart as the crowd erupts in cheers.

Minor bit of background - I'm a straight guy with a lot of LGBT friends and was actively involved in supporting the Australian same-sex marriage campaign, so FB probably had me flagged as gay at the start of 2012. 

In 2012 I started dating someone. We'd been friends for some time. I'm on Facebook all the time, she had an account but almost never used it.

We basically never communicated on Facebook.

Immediately Facebook started telling me to mark her as a 'close friend' and all of its ads changed from ""Gay Singles Cruise"" and similar to ""Romantic Getaways for Couples"".

I can only assume that it was able to tell from GPS that she spent a night at my place, and that I spent one at hers a few days later.

AskReddit,"Therapists of reddit, what was your biggest ""I know I'm not supposed to judge you but holy sh*t"" moment?",js8e1z,gbxyrpn,"I work in mental health and have worked in acute and crisis settings for the majority of my career. The most notable event I experienced was when a young person had presented with significant ongoing suicidal ideation who was dealing with a lot of shit. I spent a lot of time with them mostly deescalation and working out what the plan should be moving forward. 

One of their parents came in a little while later and I had the opportunity to speak to them about where their child was and what had been going on, with their consent of course. Midway through me trying to explain some of the psychological constructs and ways the parent could help they said to me, ""is this going to take much longer I have a show to go and watch"".

All I can say is, I never judge my patients, I have never walked their path or viewed the world through their eyes. But the people around them who perpetuate the suffering of the people I work with through ignorance, malice and selfishness, I judge them.

Edit and a shameless one. I've tried to reply to as much as I could, I've enjoyed some of what I would assume is trolling and talking about some other people's experiences as it's given me a chance to reflect on some of my own stuff. But I must go to bed. 

I'd like to ask one thing of anyone who reads this, remember that you can help, even just by asking how someone is or wishing them well. People who you think may be struggling and even people who aren't. This year has been hard on us all, and I appreciate all of you who have said that those in care services have difficult jobs, but we have all struggled this year. Please be as kind as you can to each other and I hope we can all look forward to a good December and even better new year.

Edit 2. My use of the word 'judge' needs some clarification, I do judge in some ways, it's hard not to with what I see, who I work with and the situations they experience or have experienced. What I mean by not judging is that I do not allow my judgements to distort what I am seeing or how I am working. Which will normally be to the benefit of the patient and those around them trying to help them achieve their goals and meet their needs.

Final edit. I didn't think this post would get as big as it has. And I cannot respond to every comment individually by any means. I'm sure the post will be getting less attention moving forward but I just wanted to clarify some things.

This parent, who many people have made multiple assumptions about, was not trying to redirect, deflect or remove themselves from the situation by stating they had a show to watch. The show being something else people have assumed was a TV show. Remember I've made the comment above in the context of a situation that lasted around 5 to 6 hours for me, but took you a few minutes to read.

With everything that's going on right now I wanted to make this post to let people know, those working in mental health have heard a lot, we don't judge you for how or what you're feeling and we want to work with you to help you. I simply wanted to help in some way with a comment on the Internet that I wrote in one go about an experience I have had. I know that the response to this has been overwhelmingly positive but I would also like to say I did not mean to cause any offence or upset to anyone or claim that I am some sort of unachievable goal of non-judgement. 

Anyway, I'm going to try and forget about this now.",Tedkin,40993,2020-11-11 15:40:23

This factor lead some people to not continue my course on to the next level, but it really illustrates the level of non judgement needed in this field. We all have our own personal feelings, of course, but these get talked about in supervision.

To piggy back on what others have said, it is highly unlikely for me to have moments where I judge my clients. It happens sometimes, but I’m able to shut down those thoughts quickly in my head and return to being present for the people I see. People are so incredibly complex that my judgment wouldn’t have any meaning anyway and it doesn’t have a place in our work together. 

I will admit though, something that does get me feeling a little salty is when I have a client’s parent that attempts to sabotage the therapeutic relationship I have with their child, or pulling them out of therapy entirely when some of the things we talk about challenges some potentially unhealthy family dynamics. I don’t feel anger toward the parents, mostly I feel bad for the kid.

2. ""Feeding your kid ultra Spicy Ramen each night instead of the meal everyone else is eating isn't specifically defined as abuse, but you have to understand the emotional abuse that this causes.""


3. ""Your kid isn't trying to kill you because they stand in your doorway at night crying. Thats likely because they're scared of their traumatic nightmares, but feel like you will just yell at them if they wake you up."" 

Edit: removed a phrase 


Edit2:

 Thank you all for your questions and support. This case has really helped to shape my approach to therapy, and has highlighted the importance of healthy communication between parents and kids. 

My number 1 tip: Don't let someone else tell you how you feel/think. If someone says, ""You're angry with me!"" Or something to that effect, ask yourself if you really are. If you're not actually angry, then don't spend a second more on it. A lot of kids/family members get hung up on trying to justify their own actions according to someone else's perception.

When you do those things, you can’t simultaneously judge.  We could all use a little more of that in real life, I suppose.

I’ll share this though.  I do feel concerned about this recent phenomenon of young people I worked with self-diagnosing, sharing, and identifying very closely with mental illness; as if the pendulum quickly swung from “never, ever share your feelings” to “OMG, you’re depressed? All of us are too!”  Life’s challenges can be tough and they don’t need a scientific-sounding label to be valid and real.  You are not your diagnosis. We can find validation and support in healthier ways.

I was brutally raped multiple times between the ages of 7 and 10. My one and only attempt at try to get help from a therapist was one of the most awful experiences of my life. I attempted to get help in my early 20s. Upon first going in I was asked what had happened to me, after explaining a basic outline of the abuse. I could already see that she was very dismissive and seemed not to really believe me. She then asked about my relationship status. At the time I was in a long term relationship with a woman who had 2 kids (boys). Upon finding this out she immediately demanded the names and address of my girlfriend, names of the kids and said she would be immediately getting in touch with social services to ensure that I wasn't abusing them... I can't put into words just how much that destroyed me mentally, that she could obviously see something in me that I couldn't see! That somehow she was certain that I would be an abuser! I started to cry... She told me to pull myself together. I also can't put into words the pathological visceral HATRED I have for paedophiles and rapists!! If I could get away with murdering them i would! I would NEVER NEVER EVER inflict the absolute nightmare I went through on any child. 

I got up and left, i came very VERY close to the edge of suicide that day. I also immediately ended the relationship because I couldn't deal with the thought that the kids might be at risk because of me. It's now 21 years later and I'm tearing up typing this. Because of that experience I have never sought therapist help again. I survive mentally, but its not good survival.

Edit :- Wow! Just wow! I am absolutely blown away by the Internet strangers who are sending love and care to me. I am currently alone, in the dark, in tears, reading all these replies. To answer a few questions. I'm in the UK. I heard she was fired a few years later after a patient of hers committed suicide and mentioned her 'therapy' in the note he left. I am in a position where currently I'm in such a fragile (very heavily medicated) mental state that If I saw another therapist and got the same reaction that I know my mind would break and I'd take my own life. Every day is a struggle to find reasons to stay alive. I'm sure I have ptsd as I feel the need to be armed with a knife constantly (despite being a big dude, 6'4"", 110kg) i sleep with a knife under my pillow. I often wake up screaming. I tend to be 'stand offish' with everyone, deliberately keeping people at a distance. I know I'm a broken person... I've even avoided relationships with women with kids because I don't want my broken mental state to somehow effect those kids in any way. I have attempted suicide twice and both times I survived. I just want there to be a pill or operation where I could completely wipe out the past, even wipe me out, wake up and just have a new me, minus the depression, anxiety, fear, ptsd, crushing hatred of myself, it would be nice to wake up one day and actually be able to see some value in myself. I'd love to br married and be a dad but currently I'm in a state where I can't ever see or allow that to  happen. I'm too scared that my mental state would fuck up my wife and kids lives. I can't allow that.",Anon_777,19404,2020-11-11 16:06:36

Judgement isn’t an inherently bad thing. It’s how we know that murdering people is wrong. 

So when a convicted pedophile client told me, “nothing gets me going like a pair of little girl’s worn panties”, you better believe I judged the fuck out of him. I continued to work with him and I treated him with compassion and respect because he’s a human being worthy of both; I did my job because I’m a professional. But I can’t honestly say that I didn’t judge him. I judged that he should never be around children. I judged that he is not yet ready for change. I judged that his access to his own daughter should be closely supervised. That’s a lot of judgements.

Most of them I found ways to like and admire for their positive aspects, but there were two guys in that group I just could never find “unconditional positive regard” for. One guy basically never spoke in group. He would give one word answers and occasionally just discuss how unfair the “system” was to him. I worked really hard to open him up and find things to connect over but he never opened up to me or the group. He left the group after he strangled his girlfriend and went to jail. She survived thankfully. 

The other left group early routinely, showed up late, participated minimally and similarly never wanted to open up honestly. He left early one group after we had discussed him staying to the end and threatened me when I told him he wasn’t going to get credit for attendance (something the court required). Oddly, I eventually moved into the apartment below him (completely without knowledge) and listened to him scream at his girlfriend and break shit while I called the cops. 

I judge these men. They’re shitty. Maybe they’re redeemable, but redemption requires self-exploration and they both refused to do so.

Much of my work with clients specifically focuses on how NOT to judge...our performance as employees, our value as parents or partners, and our own self-worth. Honestly, my holy shit moments have more to do with how pervasive our tendency to judge is. No matter how accomplished or resilient someone is, s/he has the capacity to judge themselves harshly, and often do. The funny thing is, we often judge ourselves much more harshly than others. So I'm often amazed at how blind people can be to their achievements and strengths and how unkind they can be to themselves. My role in those scenarios is to help them seem themselves with compassion and to help them treat themselves as they would treat a loved one. It's a simple but not easy task, and I love every minute of it. 

I doubt this response is what the OP was looking to hear, but that's what comes to mind. Judgements are simple things - labels of something (a person, an idea, an object) as good or bad. They are ubiquitous in everyday life. They are painfully easy to make, and the problem lies in that we believe them. Judgment are just thoughts, and like all thoughts, they're not necessarily true.

I can say I am worried about their safety but I can't yell ""for fuck's sake, stop going back!! What is it going to take?!"" Like I want to. 

The other situation isn't really judging the person it's more judging OCD. But OCD is weird. The infinitely weird ways it can show up are so funny and bizarre.

Anywho, my abusive parents and i got in a verbal fight in the car. My stepdad stopped the car and told me ""get out we're leaving you on the highway"". I wasn't scared because i knew i could just call the police, say i was an abandoned child, and theyd get in loads of trouble, so i said ""sounds good"" and got out. My mom then came out and started attacking me. I refused to get back in the car after the attack, so my stepdad got out, dragged me by the hair, called me a ""bipolar bitch"", and threw me in.
They made me see a therapist, they told her that i jumped out of a moving car and then i attacked my mom when she was trying to help. This therapist didn't believe anything i said and tried getting me to take bipolar meds. I knew i wasn't bipolar, i was being abused and i knew that the anger and sadness i felt was normal for my situation. She glared at me and said ""you're not nearly as smart as you think you are"". I refused to say a word in any of our therapy sessions after that, i would just go in, sit down, and she'd make snarky sarcastic remarks for a few minutes then dismiss me. She wasn't trying to help me, she was trying to help my parents.
I moved out when i was 18, went to college all on my own with no financial help from my family, got a job and left the country to be as far from them as possible. I'm on antidepressants for my PTSD and luckily the therapists ive had since my teenage years have been nothing like that horrible woman, but it still upsets me deeply thinking about it.",VulcanHumour,542,2020-11-11 18:29:11

No shade to OP, but I wish the question was, “Mental health professionals (MHP), what has surprised you the most about human behavior?” because most MHPs really don’t judge clients for what they say, but we do have “holy shit” moments. 

I’d say for me, my “Holy shit...” moment was when I realized just *how* prevalent sexual abuse in childhood is *and* that sexual abuse is most often perpetuated by an immediate family member (e.g., parent, sibling, aunt/uncle, grandparent). So whenever I hear people say they don’t believe so-and-so’s story about being sexually abused by their parent, grandparent, etc. because “that doesn’t happen” it irks the shit out of me, to put it lightly.",Ohaiyogozaimasu,379,2020-11-11 18:32:26

AskReddit,"What do you KNOW is true without evidence? What are you certain of, right down to your bones, without proof?",hzdh0g,fzih9pp,"I'm quietly convinced I made a bestselling mystery novelist change the way he writes because I criticised him on Reddit.

The novelist in question is Chris Carter; the books are the [Robert Hunter](https://www.goodreads.com/series/67232-robert-hunter) series. (Yes, the guy who has built a career on looking for serial killers is named Hunter. He works for the LAPD's Ultra-Violent Crime Unit. It's not a series that's overburdened by subtlety, is what I'm saying.) They are as schlocky a bunch of thrillers as you could ever hope to find, but for some reason I can't get enough of them, despite the fact that they're... very much not great. They lean pretty damn heavy on ridiculous tropes, and I've never seen a more Mary Sue lead than I have in this series, but the biggest complaint I have with them is that the same line appears almost literally word for word in the first nine books. I [made a comment about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/al2fp8/who_is_your_favorite_terrible_author/) on Reddit on an /r/books thread about your favourite terrible authors, and I went back through all of the books published so far just to prove my point:

>***The Crucifix Killer:*** The famous line doesn't actually appear in this book as far as I could find, but Hunter *does* drink Scotch near-constantly as the defining trait of his character. 'Across the room a stylish glass bar looked totally out of place. It was the only piece of furniture Hunter had purchased brand new and from a trendy shop. It held several bottles of Hunter’s biggest passion – single malt Scotch whisky. The bottles were arranged in a peculiar way that only he understood.' And so it begins.

>***The Executioner***: 'Single-malt Scotch whiskey was Hunter’s biggest passion. But **unlike most people, he knew how to appreciate it instead of simply getting drunk on it.**' Note that in this one and the next Carter doesn't even use the Scottish spelling ('whisky', rather than 'whiskey'), despite the fact that this is *literally Hunter's only character trait*.

>***The Night Stalker***: 'Hunter’s biggest passion was single malt Scotch whiskey, but **unlike most, he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.'**

>***The Death Sculptor***: 'Hunter sat at the bar and ordered a double dose of 12-year-old GlenDronach with two cubes of ice. Single-malt Scotch whisky was his biggest passion, and though he had overdone it a few times **he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.**'

>***The Hunter***: 'Hunter’s father had a passion for single malt Scotch whisky. A passion that, frankly, Hunter had never understood. He found whisky, any type of whisky, way too overwhelming for his palate.' (I actually quite like this one; it's a prequel novella, so this one is a nice little meta throwback. It gets a pass from me.)

>***One By One***: 'Hunter would never consider himself an expert, but **he knew how to appreciate the flavor and robustness of single malts, instead of simply getting hammered on them.** Though, sometimes, getting hammered worked just fine.' This is also the first appearance of the '... but sometimes getting drunk works just fine, am I right?' addendum. It's nice to see Carter branching out a little, but after this he never looks back.

>***An Evil Mind***: 'Single-malt Scotch whisky was Hunter’s biggest passion. Unlike so many, **he knew how to appreciate its palate instead of just getting drunk on it.** Though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.'

>***I Am Death***: 'Back in the living room, wrapped in a white towel, Hunter switched on a floor lamp and dimmed its intensity to ‘medium’. That done, he approached his drinks cabinet, which was small but held an impressive collection of single malt Scotch whisky, which was probably his biggest passion. Though he had overdone it a few times, **Hunter sure knew how to appreciate the flavor and quality of a good single malt, instead of simply getting drunk on it.**'

>***The Caller***: 'Hunter’s biggest passion was single malt Scotch whisky. Back in his apartment, tucked in a corner of his living room, an old-fashioned drinks cabinet held a small but impressive collection of single malts that would probably satisfy the palate of most connoisseurs. Hunter would never consider himself an expert on whisky but, unlike so many, **he at least knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality, instead of simply getting drunk on it**, though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.' *The Caller* also gets double points for helpfully informing us that women just don't *get* the subtle nuances of Scotch: 'Hunter tried not to frown at her again, but he was sincerely intrigued. Women in general weren’t very fond of Scotch whisky, which wasn’t at all surprising. Whisky was undoubtedly an acquired taste, one that at first would certainly overpower anyone’s palate and knock the air out of their lungs in the process. Hunter knew that only too well. The trick was to persist, to keep trying, to keep sipping it until one day it finally made sense. Women usually weren’t that patient with drinks. They either liked it at first sip or they didn’t.' This, by the by, is how we know that the woman in question is trustworthy, because... reasons?

>***Gallery of the Dead***: 'Back in his apartment, Hunter had a small but impressive collection of Scotch that would probably satisfy the palate of most connoisseurs. He would never consider himself an expert, but unlike so many of his friends, who also claimed to enjoy single malt Scotch whisky, **he knew how to appreciate the flavors and robustness of the malts, instead of simply getting drunk on them**. Though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.'

That post was made in January of 2019; in April, his book *Hunting Evil* came out, and the line was nowhere to be seen. I didn't think much of it until his new book, *Written in Blood*, came out a few days ago, and also didn't have the line in it. This comment is also one of the top answers if [you google his name and the book series via Reddit](https://www.google.com/search?ei=4i0gX5zqLofCgQaovovgBA&q=chris+carter+robert+hunter+reddit&oq=chris+carter+robert+hunter+reddit&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoFCAAQsAM6BAgAEA1Q_SpY6T9gsEFoAXAAeACAAW2IAccIkgEEMTIuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwic46WhjPDqAhUHYcAKHSjfAkwQ4dUDCAs&uact=5) -- exactly what you'd do if you were looking to see if people on the internet were talking about your books. I also can't find [any evidence of anyone else pointing this out in a review or suchlike](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&ei=6oAgX8euJMKT8gKbrp3YBA&q=%22chris+carter%22+scotch+%22robert+hunter%22&oq=%22chris+carter%22+scotch+%22robert+hunter%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB46BwgAELADEB46BggAEBYQHjoFCCEQoAE6BAghEBVQ2hdYrjpggD5oAXAAeACAAYkBiAH3C5IBBDEyLjSYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjHy-642_DqAhXCiVwKHRtXB0sQ4dUDCAs&uact=5).

So yeah... in short, three months after I made that comment, he broke the habit of a decade of writing and finally decided that after *nine stories* that used this as a crutch for Hunter's personality, it was too much.

Sounds super strange, especially coming from someone like myself - an ex world of Warcraft gamer. I had kids, got busy with work, wanted out of the suburbs, got some land in the country, and started planting stuff. Years later I have what I call a food forest. I have replaced lawns with fruit trees, bushes, vines, flowers, all woven together to mimic a natural forest - except everything in it is edible.

It has changed my life completely. 

I just think there's something about being outside in the sun, feet on soil, hands in dirt, planting shit. Watching it grow in the background of your life. Going out and checking on it and watching how much bigger it is getting. Watching life find it, and now you get to live WITH the natural world, not isolated from it. 

Birds making nests in your trees, frogs making home in your ponds, seeing bees all around your flowers, butterflies everywhere. Rabbits and squirrels moving in, then owls moving in to eat those. It's this wonderful trophic cascade that you started, and it's incredibly rewarding.

Plus, being able to just walk outside and get chemical-free nutrient-rich dinner is amazing. You can see my food forest in my post history if anyone is interested in seeing what I'm doing.

I actually think a big reason depression is such a big thing these days is because we have all become so disconnected from the life that we evolved in for the last 6 million years. We evolved walking around savannahs and forests, pulling food off bushes and trees, out in the sun, feet in the soil, hands in the dirt. We couldn't be further from that, living inside our isolated homes, cars and offices. It's no wonder we're all so depressed.

I think gardening is the secret to happiness.

I was a huge fan of DW at the time and the competition was actually run through schools, so my teacher made the entire class do it, but I was very excited.

I began writing a story about the Doctor landing on a planet full of defective cybermen, who's programming had gone a wry and had been left on this asylum planet to rot. The Doctor lands there in response to a mysterious distress call from a woman and attempts to find and save her while avoiding the dangerous dysfunctional cybermen and the looming threat of planetary destruction at the hands of the normal cybermen. I finished my short treatment and gave it to my teacher to submit. Unfortunately it turned out the competition was very strict about the formatting of submissions and mine was returned because I had used the wrong formatting in some way, it seemed like a weird reason. I was a bit disappointed and that was the end of that.

But then, a year or two later, there was an episode of DW called Asylum of the Daleks, which seemed incredibly similar to my story except with Daleks. So incredibly, eerily, similar in fact, that to this day I am absolutely convinced that Steven Moffat saw my script and came up with a formatting excuse so that he could remove me from the competition, steal my story, change the bad guys and claim it as his own. I have zero evidence, I don't even still have the treatment I wrote, or any letter from the BBC about my submission, and yet I know in my bones that Steven Moffat stole his script from 10 yr old me.",vanhet,15823,2020-07-28 17:41:48

AskReddit,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg, US Supreme Court Justice, passed at 87",ivici8,g5rxt1l,"I have a mixed bag of feelings for Justice Ginsburg, but the largest emotion is definitely gratitude and respect. 

I am grateful for the trailblazing role she had for women in the legal world. She had such an incredible career, which is saying so much more considering her time. She talked often about being the only female in law school courses. She balanced an incredible career while also giving birth to and raising two kids. Those things were virtually unheard of in her day.

As an attorney, I’ve read quite a few of Ginsburg’s words over the years. I wasn’t a huge fan of much of her legal reasoning, but I very much appreciated the role she played in the court. I sort of felt that she played to polar-opposites to Scalia and Thomas, and that all three of them would regularly make up legal reasoning to get where they wanted to be politically. She was absolutely necessary in her extreme opposition, especially the past few years. It’ll be sad to see her seat likely filled with someone from the opposite extreme. 

I wish our court hadn’t become a political playground of presidents. In my utopian world, we’d figure out a way for justices to be moderate or regularly replaced. Then again, that’s a massive pipe dream.",Panama_Scoot,105,2020-09-19 02:56:41

We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president’s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.

By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.

President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”

Lay flat on your back, take deep breaths through your nose. As you exhale mentally relax each muscle group starting with your face and working down to your toes. Try to imagine exhaling through your muscles and out through your toes. Imagine your body slowly melting into your bed. This usually takes about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  
  
Next imagine as vividly as possible a river. It helps if you use one from memory. I personally use a combination of The River Wild movie and memories from a family trip to the Green River. Imagine yourself walking out to the middle of the river. Let yourself get lost in the flow around you. Try to imagine any stray thoughts as floating to you on the river. As you think of things, set them in the water and watch them float away.  
  
This process without fail gets me to sleep within 10 minutes, if I am having trouble sleeping. But like Ralph Wiggum, sleep is where I am a viking.

1. I’m a doer, he is a thinker. Worrying about stuff keeps him up at night where as I go to bed with the reassurance I’ve done all I can do that day and que sera sera
2. He brings his phone to bed and browses reddit, I’m strictly no screens an hour before bed.
3. Other than bringing the phone to bed, he has no routine. By about 9:30, I’m winding down with my skincare routine, washing up, making a hot drink, and then in bed with a book by 10:15 at the latest
4. Since I’m the high energy person in the relationship, I am moving and doing things all the time - get home from work, cooking, have dinner, work out, do some laundry, read before bed. I’m pretty physically tired/drained by the time I hit the pillow.

- exercise during the day
- wake up & go to bed at the same time every day (if possible), that way your body knows when it's time to crash 
-  magnesium supplement with melatonin & GABA about an hour before I want to fall asleep
- weighted. blanket. For whatever reason helps me relax like nothing else.
- I actually can now usually fall asleep within a few minutes of going to bed, but if not I play a little mind game. Body scanning is a solid one, just imagine a ray of sunlight slowly going over you from your toes to your head, and relax your muscles as the ""sunlight"" goes over them. I hope that makes sense - there's a lot of guided meditations on YouTube that can walk you through it. I also pick a category and try to name one thing in that category for every letter of the alphabet (ex. fruits: Apple, Banana, Cantaloupe, zzzzzzz). And finally I sometimes imagine walking down to the beach near my house and taking a nap there, although I rarely make it far enough to take a nap now. 

None of this stuff works right away, but even one can make a huge difference with some commitment, so just  give it a bit of time :)

Edit to add: KEEP! YOUR! ROOM! COLD!!!! This one actually worked for me a bit more quickly because I had/have issues with nightmares (to the point where my husband literally can calm me down in his sleep), and I saw a major correlation between that and the heat of my room. I switched from a duvet that had me waking up drenched in sweat to a weighted blanket with a bamboo cover that manages to not trap my body heat. Apparently hot showers before bed and wearing warm socks can also help you cool down as your body tries to self-regulate (or something?)",Squeaksmcgueaks,466,2020-02-10 04:13:19

Start by turning off all electronics you are using, lay down, close your eyes, and NO MATTER WHAT do not open them till morning.

At first it's painful because you'll lay with your eyes shut for hours in boredom but after a few weeks of doing this every night your body gets trained into falling asleep faster and faster.

* I try to make my bed or at least keep it semi-made, because I have an easier time falling asleep when the sheets are straight and my blanket's lined up properly.

* I wear white cotton pajamas without buttons or anything scratchy because if I'm even a little bit uncomfortable it's much harder to fall asleep.

* I braid my hair before bed, which stops my hair from getting in my face (because again, I can't sleep if I'm uncomfortable.)  As an added bonus, keeping my hair braided stops it from wrapping around my neck and throttling me while I sleep.

* I use a very heavy blanket.  (It's not weighted, but I knit it myself and handknit blankets weigh more than store-bought blankets.)

* I keep my feet warm, because for some reason that helps.  Depending on the season, I'll either use a heated blanket, heating pad, or just wear socks.

* I don't try to go to bed unless I actually feel tired.  There's this sort of wave of sleepiness that hits me at night, and if I get in bed ~20 minutes of that happening, I pass out almost immediately.  (If I miss that window, I get an adrenaline rush and will be up forever.)

* I try to do soothing, repetitive things at night before bed.  Knitting, folding laundry, etc.

* Sometimes I wear blue-light filtering glasses because that is supposed to help your body properly produce sleep hormones.  And if it doesn't, well, the placebo affect's pretty powerful too.

You say, ""eh, I'll figure it out later when I need to know it"" and stop paying attention.

I've taught in several schools that have tried to teach social skills, kindness, meditation, financial literacy, etc. In every case, the kids did not care. It was their least favorite part of the day because it felt like a waste of time.

The point of education is to teach thinking, not doing. A well-educated student can teach themselves these things. A quick Google search can teach you how to file taxes, cook, etc. But you can't Google how to do Algebra 2 and expect to understand what you read without some background in the subject matter.

Edit: I got upvotes? Now I'm mad with power, so I'll say this: 

I hear arguments like this post all the time, and I think the real issue is people not taking responsibility. ""I can't cook? That must be the school's fault! We need education reform!"" No, it's not the school's fault. It's your fault. You could literally Google a recipe in 20 seconds. Stop blaming other people for your problems.

People don't realize that the point of education isn't to teach facts, but the change your brain. For example, physics and math majors earn the highest scores in the MCAT, GMAT, and LSAT. It's not because they learned those things in class, but because their curriculum emphasizes logical thinking.

Boil an egg? Change a tire? Get your prescriptions filled?"" It boggles the mind that kids would be willing to sit their ass in a chair at school for hours to passively listen to this, while ""adulting"" simly means that you take the time to look it up yourself and learn on your own. Since you are ""adulting"", you get to decide how much time you want to spend on any of these things.

Learning to cook does not mean you have to become a chef, it just means you can feed yourself reasonably nutritious food that you enjoy eating. You can go all out and learn to bake a fancy quiche if you enjoy it, or just learn to fry a couple of eggs in two minutes. You decide, and have the power over how you want to feed yourself.

It's ok if you don't want to learn to do your taxes, although if you only have one job and don't have properties or business, it can be so straightforward that it's probably worth learning to do on your own in a couple of hours.

There's no need to buy a sewing machine to alter your clothes unless you think you would enjoy it as a permanent hobby, but anyone can spend a couple of dollars on a cheap sewing kit and look up how to sew a button, because it only takes a few minutes and it does come in handy. Totally fine to wait until your button falls off.

There are no prescribed items you must know to be an adult, you just have to do the best you can with what you have, and that often means learning something new on your own when needed, and you get to decide how to do it.",yourhaploidheart,109,2021-01-28 06:03:46

People who complain about not being taught how to do their taxes tend to have shitty numeracy skills. People who struggle to fill out a form tend to have shitty literacy. Can't read instructions? Literacy issue. You can make education as practical as possible but the fact is: many don't want to learn, until it's too late. I say this as a teacher: we really do a lot to make education as relevant to real-world needs as possible but there is not getting around the fact that a person must learn to be fluent in both reading and writing, as well as be able to think mathematically to cope in the ""real world"". The rest of what we do is for the purpose of teaching you how to learn effectively, how to think in different ways, how to adapt to unfamiliar challenges and how to deal with abstract ideas. We don't teach the model of the atom because you need to know where the elections go. We teach you so that you can learn how to grasp concepts that are not directly observable, make logical conclusions from them and apply abstract ideas to real-world phenomena. The actual topics are just vehicles for these skills",Rhaski,31,2021-01-28 08:42:53

I did not learn anything at home but taught myself, I didn't have much education either due to neglect.
I needed to learn and for the most part if you can read instructions then you can do it. Today there is Youtube and such as well. I'm not sure why people can't do laundry or cook if they can read. 
I'm thinking also....my kids all took Home Economics, Sewing, etc so isn't it already there?
So my first thought is it would be a really boring class for some that don't need it but an easy credit and helpful for those that do. An extra hour of their time everyday adds up though and not worth it if not needed.
I'm also thinking since we moved to a different state the education here is shockingly terrible. We've been blown away at the lack of education and efforts to push kids through the system at all costs.
My son came home laughing on his first day because tests here aren't actually tests; the teacher shares the answers when someone raises their hand.
It's crazy. 
My daughter had an assignment on her 3rd day here regarding a subject she had no knowledge of because she entered mid term and should have failed or had to redo it after studying because she only got a 56 on it. The teacher  gave her a B+ with some story about knowing half of it anyway. That's not right, she doesn't learn the subject if she's being pushed through. 
Something needs to be done but I don't have any answers. I'm so so concerned about kids growing up in this type of school system. They can barely read.
Maybe that's half the problem right there.",LeileiBG,16,2021-01-28 05:28:12

I just sat and mostly listened.

AskReddit,"What was the best ""you have no power here"" moment you have ever seen?",izk9gh,g6jmj50,"A few years ago I interviewed for a job (in the US) that was labeled as a senior-level position, which is my level of experience in this field.

I go through 2 phone interviews and a stellar in-person interview. Shortly after the in-person interview, they call me and say they absolutely loved me and that I would be a great fit at the company. However, they thought I was ""a little too green"" (implying I was inexperienced) for the senior-level position, but lucky for me they have an opening for the junior-level position (at a salary decrease). 

I kindly told them that the reason I applied to their job posting in the first place was because it was a senior-level position and that I wasn't going to take a step backwards in my career by taking a junior-level position since I had both the appropriate experience and the work history. I also let them know that trying to trick someone with senior-level experience into taking a junior-level position by stringing them along through interviews and a job offer was deceptive and unethical.

There was silence over the phone for a moment and then the interviewer said in an offended tone, ""Well we've all had to make sacrifices for [company name]!"" To which I replied, ""You may have had to, but I don't make sacrifices for anyone.""

Stunned silence. 

Then the interviewer, who was so appalled that they didn't know what to say, replies, ""Well ... Maybe you can think about it and I'll call you tomorrow to check in ...""

I said, ""No thank you and please don't call me."" and hung up the phone.

One of the first actions was a mandatory HR meeting. They used their US power point deck and guided us through the rules & regulations although directed by our local HR team to not do that: Here are some of the highlights:

* We are not allowed to accept tickets for the Super Bowl. Utterly confusion - 90% of the people had never heard of the Super Bowl... a discussion about why we would want to watch that anyways, started. 
* We are not allowed to have relationship with anybody from a supplier or within the company. Uproar in the room:
   * This is against the German constitution - what you do in your free time is non of their business. 
   * The discussion gets heated, everybody is discussing. The Americans on the line are very confused why.... 
   * The head of QA finally gets up and shouts ""If I love that woman, nobody will prevent me from dating her"". 
   * People signed the sheet that they participated and read and understood the presentation with ""with reservations""
   * People start discussing where to sign up for legal expenses insurance. 

HR refrained from that day from having mandatory global HR meetings. 

Management tried a couple of other stuff - at will employment (against the law - everybody has a contract), cutting vacation (against the law), canceling bank holidays (against the law). Make people work on vacation days (guess what, against the law) and a couple more.

AskReddit,"What was the best ""you have no power here"" moment you have ever seen?",izk9gh,g6jtm1a,"Probably watching a few Texas DPS Officers realize they couldn't shut down a whole airport.

I was working as a flight instructor at small airport on a Saturday afternoon.  We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.

About 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were ""locking it down"" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.

The airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said ""I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere"", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said ""it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.

I was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said ""you need to be careful"" and the cop quickly retorted ""AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?"" and he said ""because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller"" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.

I walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said ""you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!""  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said ""have a nice flight AjaxBU!"" 

You could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.

We had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",AjaxBU,7921,2020-09-25 16:46:55

The other evening I was out gardening (because it’s hot during the day and we have the luck of having a streetlight right next to our front yard, keeping it pretty well illuminated even after sundown, I mostly garden at night), and I thought I had gotten the hose twisted, as it kept getting stuck. This went on for a bit, when I realized that it wasn’t stuck, but being pulled. I looked into the dim area just past the illumination of the street light and spied my father, crouched over and tugging the hose. Well I did the only reasonable thing to do, and I sprayed him. He yelled and ran inside with me chasing.

Dad comes back about a half hour later and starts yelling again, but at this point, it's all I can do to not just laugh. I know that the instant I stand up, the argument will end.

It actually wound up being really good for our relationship, because Dad realized that he actually had to make valid points, rather than just going into former drill sergeant mode.

i havent seen that guy in town in a while.",nowforever13,4161,2020-09-25 15:44:12
AskReddit,"What was the best ""you have no power here"" moment you have ever seen?",izk9gh,g6jkb42,"In college I worked for a small catering company that was started by a guy who was barely much older than college age himself, no more than early 30’s. All of us that worked for him were college age or just over as well, so it was a young looking crew in general. 

One day we were working an outdoor black-tie wedding reception for over 300 people, and it was a scorcher out too temperature-wise. So not only was it hot out and we’re all in tuxes serving a shit-ton of people, the family of the bride who are funding this affair are some of the rudest and most-demanding people imaginable, so it was not the most fun gig in general. 

Well, one of the aunts on the bride’s turned out to be the rudest of the bunch and kept trying to pull the “I’m related to the bride so give me give me give me”-act (even though she wasn’t even in the fucking wedding party), and was just making the lives of any one of us who came in contact with her even more of a living hell than what we were experiencing, including the owner of the company, who was lead bartender at the main bar. 

Now that point is key because, by some grace of whatever higher power/force/fate/kismet or whatever you call it, I was also working that same bar, which gave me the opportunity to bear witness to the most beautifully constructed instance of comeuppance to which I had ever seen to that point, and don’t expect to ever see it bettered again: the nightmare bitch aunt is in young bossman’s bar line, and loudly complaining the whole time how long it’s taking, and she shouldn’t even have to be waiting in a line anyway because she’s whatever-the-bride’s name’s aunt, blah-blah-blah, just making a huge stink. When she got up to the head of the line to place her order, she said something along the lines of how slow and ineffectual he was, to which he responded something along the lines of “we’re going as the fast as we can, here’s your drink, have a nice evening” (through gritted teeth I’m sure), which led her into the following diatribe: “That’s because you’re nothing but a bunch of dumbass kids - don’t you have any adults back there working this wedding? I want to talk to your manager or the owner or someone who’s an adult who can get you out of here and get the job done right.” To which a huge shit-ass-eating grin washed over his face as he replied, “Hi! My name (his name). I am the owner of this catering company, please note that if you would like for me to go, then this reception will have no food or beverages or bar service.” 

I swear you could almost hear a hype crew descending from the heavens shouting “OHHHHHHH!!!” after he said it. It was a moment of transcendence I don’t think I’ll ever experience again. Plus, the bitchy aunt didn’t bother us again the rest of the night.

AskReddit,"What was the best ""you have no power here"" moment you have ever seen?",izk9gh,g6juadr,"A few years ago a guy stopped me in the hardware store and asked if I was a painter. I looked down at my painters whites and said, yeah I do historical restoration work. He asked how much I charge per hour, and when I told him, he immediately told me I was too expensive and dropped my rate by 25%. I had already given him my number, but he kept belittling me, and saying I wasn't worth it. I just told him that I already had a full time job, and this would be in my off hours, so it needed to be worth my while. He finally let me leave the store, then called me 3 or 4 times, each time hemming and hawing over if he wanted to actually use me or not, he's got a bunch of properties, it would be a sweet gig, but not at those prices. And I just kept telling him that's fine, don't use me if you don't want to. Eventually I recognized his number and stopped picking up. 

He really thought he had some sort of power over me, and I'd jump at the opportunity. Luckily I didn't have to take the work, I was making good enough money as it was. He would have nitpicked absolutely everything, and probably not paid me at the end anyway. But he was so certain he'd have power in the situation, that he didn't seem able to comprehend me not wanting to barter with him.",Hopefulkitty,4058,2020-09-25 16:52:29

I can tell me to socialize more. Sitting depressed at my apartment won't get me any new friends and will make me more of a loner.

Think about the butterfly effect, if you do one tiny thing differently in  those 8 years you could end up not meeting a dear friend, girlfriend, wife, etc. You could end up completely changing the course of your life not necessarily for the better. Think about all of the good memories over the last 8 years that would evaporate when you eventually make that first different decision. Remember, this isn't a video game, you have to remember exactly what you did over 8 years if you want any sense of normalcy, and trying to do that with a mindset 8 years ahead? Forget about it. You could try to avert one bad thing that happened to you and end up in a worse situation down the line. This situation is a lot more stressful and complicated than people realize.

My job was to make sure only people with employee cards got buzzed in and none of the residents got out of the blue door that led to the dementia ward. The gig payed well enough but FML it didn't pay nearly enough for the nurses & the shit I saw they had to deal with.

I had some good memories at least, especially of a blind veteran that would always stop by at the same time every day to chat. He loved telling old war stories and I enjoyed hearing them he was good at telling them.

But the dementia ward would ruin that every night. So many of them screaming they had been kidnapped or that they didn't know where they were. I remember one had gotten out, kind little old lady in her pajamas I found her on the side of the road trying to hitch hike to the mall.

He is depressed because there is nothing to remember and nothing to look forward to. He has not been able to articulate his needs for at least 3 years. He gets angry when asked to put on pants. Poops himself regularly, and gets angry about that too. Sometimes he tries to hit housemates. Sometimes he lifts up my skirt because he believes I am hiding something.

He was living independently and driving before moving in with the family. He was a great man, and still tries to be polite to others when he isn't afraid/ashamed. Cognitive decline takes away more and more of a person, until there is not much left. Early dementia can damage a person's ability to feel enjoyment by physically damaging their brain.

In 2014 I lived in a rest home for 6 weeks when my care agency pulled out of the contract to provide my care. 

I never ever want to end up in one again. I saw neglect, elderly with mental health issues no one was dealing with... actually a lot of mental health issues and everyone just said ""oh there old"" ack, one lady had OCD and would not leave her chair all day because she was afraid of everything having germs. No one cared.

I had to deal with angry mean staff who took any criticism very harsh, I did not feel I had proper privacy... There were also a few old men with sexual urges who had no idea how to manage them too. It was a big issue they were struggling with.

Then there were the people dying around you. in those 6 weeks about 4 people died. Then a few days later someone else was in there room. 

It is not a place I would ever go willingly too. Going back is one of my fears. You need to be a certain type of person to handle it... So many sad people, so many lost people and so many people who would cry because their family would not visit.

I've seen a couple posts about how someone could exploit desperate dudes on Craigslist by buying women's panties, spritzing them with perfume, and then selling them online. Were it so easy!

Nowadays, buyers want to see photos of a real woman in the exact pair they'll be buying, or proof in the form of being Pantytrust certified. They'll want extras or special requests for their order (plenty of fetishes to go around), and the vast majority of them will drop off the face of the earth when it comes time to actually pay. You'll have to sift through hundreds of responses to your ad, knowing most of them will be time-wasters just trying to get a little dirty talk or some photos.

AskReddit,What looks easy peasy lemon squeezy but is actually difficult difficult lemon difficult?,depwkk,f2yhgmt,"Writing a long story.

I'm about to finish wrapping up my first ever seriously long form piece of writing. It's going to about about 160K all told. You may think to yourself, _'That's not too long, I can read a book that length in an afternoon.""_, or _'I can knock that out in a month or two, just writing a couple thousand words a day.'_, or _'You just tell a story and it all leaps out fully formed.'_

And you'd be wrong.

Writing, as enjoyable as it can be for author and audience, is a lot of work you just don't see. Yeah, you see the finished product, but what you don't see are things like drafts, discarded scenes, variant writings, conversations with editors, freewriting exercises, and all the just sheer ideas that come up and don't make it. I'd estimateI have easily spent more than a million words behind the scenes making this project happen.

It sound easy: you have a plot and you make it happen, starting at page 1, and do through to the back cover. A lot of my writing is somewhat out of order; starting from page 1 is honestly a snoozefest and chore -- I don't want to read the part of the fantasy story that's Farm Boy baling hay, and nobody really likes that part either unless they're a medievalist and the book goes full Tolkien about how that works. I have probably deleted 75% of all the words I've ever spawned for the product.

Beyond spewing words, there's tone to mind, characters to track, continuity, foreshadowing, building, managing tension, avoiding forcing cliches or stupidity, making imagery, dialogue that's nice to read and also you can imagine being spoken... And this has to all be managed under a word count that's enough for your reader to get the point without boring them or wearing your fingers to nubs.

Want to know how long it's taken me to write this thing? 2 fucking years. I've loved it, but hot damn, it was way harder than it looks when you just see the finished product and can just think I sat down one day and make it all come to life without complication.

Writing a novel length piece of fiction is tough. I plan to do more, but I no longer have the idea I'll be able to just pump out a piece every couple months like clockwork at a couple thousand words a day.",762Rifleman,471,2019-10-07 23:38:56

He's just a normal bird, lives with his family in Birbtown, which is south-east to Krikitititikitikiti. His father served a decade ago and really never kinda came back, you know? He once almost poked the his soon-to-be son's egg in a burst of anger. The machine guns are a foreign concept, you got to understand- they run and hit and stuff but can't shoot, can't comprehend that something can move that fast. There was a human raid on their peaceful community a week ago, and now emu-nationalists call for the ethnic cleansing of all of the human minorities living in Krikitititikitikiti and the surrounding cities of Krok and Pkaa'apkpk, where most humans live. He thinks, and I share this feeling, that everyone know this war from a human perspective, and people from all races- birds and non-birds- should learn the war from both sides.",Tamtumtam,35,2020-09-05 18:22:10

AskReddit,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,gvj9a9,fspbaxj,"I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied “too” at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. “All Lives Matter” is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.

Modern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It’s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It’s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It’s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential. It’s enforcing laws in school that don’t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is “unprofessional” and a “distraction” to other students. It’s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a “demographic” without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It’s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It’s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what “black people” are to others across the world (imagine you’re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you’ll assume that must be true).

When  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at “one of them tech companies”. I hugged him & told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn’t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn’t  have to deal with?

So please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we’re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don’t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don’t have to pass down that generational trauma.

If you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don’t hear others.

EDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow!

The police were right next to the protesters and the two parties were talking and working with each other about what needs to be done so that everyone involved can go home safely after. It was very civil and honestly uplifting to see black protesters working with white police officers in this political climate, and in a way that makes sure no one gets hurt, innocent people don't lose homes or business.

Another protester got up and said that he talked to the neighborhood association asking permission to use certain streets and how they need to be respectful of the property because destroying it isn't going to help anyone.

BUT THEN!! some stupid little white kid got up, and I quote, ""they want us to be peaceful... we need to fuck everything up to get our point across!"" He was met with boos and blank stairs.

Black lives matter.,gvj9a9,fspiowv,"I want to go on record saying I attended a protest in a small Tennessee town tonight, for a short while, and while I was there it was \*not\* the protesters who got violent.  They were very kind to me when I asked if I could take  and document, when I explained that I would not post them under my own name out of respect for the tragic event, and as I set up my camera. All they did was give me their blessing, nod, and go back to yelling ""Fuck Racism! Fuck the KKK!"", “What do we want? Justice!”, “What was his name? George Floyd!”, and “Peace! Love! Unity!” on loop.

It was a older white male-a good 'ol southern boy-who started the first skirmish. He yelled at the protesters, telling them to shut up about the KKK as they couldn't possibly understand, and told them if they didn't comply he would \*make\* them. When they continued to protest, he walked up to them and begun to yell even louder. He jabbed a finger towards them and when a protestor did it back, defending their personal space, he screamed that they had better not do it again.

Police surrounded the town square a minute later. Sirens on, lights blazing, as officers descended on the scene. The officers behaved as they should have. They separated the protestors and the man. Officers stayed with the protesters, even as they started chanting again, while others appeared to be interrogating the man. As I walked back to my car, the man was in cuffs being led to a police car.

Nobody should be murdered for the color of their skin. That shouldn’t be a debate. Black people are receiving a horrible media edit, and it’s extremely disheartening. People are rioting and angry (rightfully so), and the president, republicans, and other outlets are twisting the narratives. Rioting gave women rights, rioting gave the lgbtq+ community rights, and rioting gave us the right to vote.  It is an absolute and legitimate way to be heard, and objects should not be prioritized over people. Those who are using this as a time for pure destruction are NOT part of the movement, and shouldn’t be seen as. Police are instigating most of the violence as well as white ‘protestors’ trying to live out their anarchy fantasies, and anti blm groups. Protests are being staged, bricks are being placed at protest sights, and people are being brutally beaten and permanently scarred at rallies where we are fighting for our RIGHTS. I get the anger at the riots, but ask yourself, why do you value property and merchandise over human life. What can we do? We’ve peacefully protested everytime this has happened and NO CHANGE HAS COME. Our victims deserve change and justice. Unjust police are have way too much power in our society, and should be held accountable. Growing up oppressed is hard. being called slurs in school, having to educate ‘friends’ who refuse to see, dealing with blatant prejudice from people who refuse to see that you are a PERSON. If you are silent in this time, it’s very loud. esp for non black people. Use your privilege to the highest extent possible, it can be a catalyst for change and save lives. EDUCATE YOURSELF!! Donate, read, learn, sign petitions, talk to your black friends!! If you don’t, you are making the problem even worse and contributing to the disgusting narrative. Just because it might not PERSONALLY affect you, doesn’t mean the problem is non-existent. Stop being loud about the RIOTS, be loud about the 400 years of OPPRESSION and MURDER!

As a white conservative-leaning male, I can't say that I understand what black people go through but I hear you. George Floyd was murdered by a man and a group of 3 other men that watched it all happen and did nothing. All of them swore an oath to protect and serve and simply didn't.

The protestors who are peaceful are getting drowned by the looters and I hate it. I haven't gone out to protest because I'm terrified of things getting out of hand and the virus. I personally lost my childhood best friend and my mom's best friend who was like another mother me to this virus and I'm still shook. I can't bring myself to large gatherings yet, it will take me a while.

As a white conservative-leaning male, I believe both sides aren't doing anything. What I believe the people simply want is justice and equality. We need to call on both sides of the aisle and ask for accountability among law enforcement. How is it that a man with a tarnished record was able to carry on his duty as a police officer? There needs to be put forth a law stating that those who protect and serve should be held to a higher standard and potentially make it standard to wear a body camera so when there are altercations, we have a witness. I know there is no one solution to all this but we can start somewhere.

Now will that end all the racism? Absolutely not. We all have to join in the effort of stopping racism in our everyday lives no matter your skin color. We need to teach our next generation that there is no black, white, yellow or brown races; there is the human race. If you pass by somebody of color, simply smile or wave. Start up a conversation with someone you normally wouldn't with a simple ""Hi my name is (name), and you are? Well it's nice to meet you  How are you? How is your day?"" That alone might make someone's day and start to ease some of your own bias.

Something I haven't mentioned yet is my profession. I am a high school teacher in a very mixed community. We have students of all races and socio-economic backgrounds in our buildings. We have students who are food insecure sitting next to kids who will only eat food from whole foods. I wish I was in school right now. So I can tell all my students of color all this. So I can dab them up and let them know I am here for them. It's hard to convey that message over zoom. It's hard to take class time to talk about their feelings. I'd do anything to get that all back.

So as a white conservative-leaning male, I'm with you all and I hope for a brighter future with fairness and equality. I pray for a brighter and more fair future. I promise that I will always be in support of the human race.",sfa7x,146,2020-06-03 02:56:52

Up until a month ago I didnt believe in BLM. I didnt believe in white privilege, I didnt believe racism was still an issue, and I thought that black americans should just obey the law if they didnt want to be killed.

I was absolutely wrong on all points.

It doesnt make you a bad person if you don't understand them. Do everything you can to understand it though. Research, read books, and ask your black friends what it means to them. 

Even if you don't understand then be just there for your black friends. Let them know that you'll stand up for them regardless of what you think or feel.

If you want help trying to understand it..think of it this way:

John's son is killed in a car accident. John ask his friends to come over and be with him because he needs support and love from them. All of his friends still have healthy and living kids so they dont understand. So instead they say ""Just know that a lot of kids die everyday. It's not just your kid that died. It's happened to a lot of kids.""

Technically, John's friends are correct, kids do die everyday, but it wasnt the response John needed. John needed their support and empathy for his loss. He needed them to focus on helping him in that moment. 

That's what Black Lives Matters is all about.  Be there for your black friends and family. Let them know you'll stand with them.

AskReddit,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,gvj9a9,fsp24vy,"Progression? Well, I was quite surprised when I had seen Joe Biden's recent speech, as he called for a special independent force to investigate officer involved crimes. A solution that, I often wondered why, was not the pivotal demand of protestors. 

Contrary to what some people think, the police are not who make the decision to charge someone with a crime. Police do wield tremendous investigatory and persuasive power, but the decision of whether or not to officially charge a person with a crime lies with the prosecutor, who will be the local district attorney if you are charged with a state-level crime, or the U.S. District Attorney if you are charged with a federal crime.

There is an inherent conflict of interest in the American justice system arising out of the intimate police-prosecutor relationship that has evolved in the United States over the last forty years. While police and prosecutors formerly operated as independent units, a concerted effort to join forces has resulted in close working relationships. These relationships have increasingly led law enforcement to employ perjury and unethical tactics to obtain unjust convictions against criminal defendants. In addition, they have allowed law enforcement to commit atrocious acts without fear of punishment. And, because police and prosecutors enjoy immunity under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for almost any conduct, victims and their families are often left without recourse in either a criminal or civil forum—even when law enforcement officials commit criminal, malicious, or bad faith acts against them. 

> “Prosecutors work with police day in, day out, and typically they’re reluctant to criticise them or investigate them,” said Prof Samuel Walker of the University of Nebraska. Describing Lugod’s case as a cause for concern, Walker said: “A major change in our standard legal practice, and the structure of our criminal justice system, is required.”

> Among the 95% of district attorneys who are elected, many like Kleine receive valuable donations and public endorsements from police unions for their campaigns. The alternative, a “soft on crime” denunciation, can be electorally toxic. These unions frequently go on to provide legal representation for officers in fatal shootings handled by the same prosecutor.

> The consequences of falling out of favour with the police lobby can be dire. In Texas, Dallas County DA Craig Watkins was unseated by challenger Susan Hawk this year after police unions ploughed tens of thousands of dollars into Hawk’s campaign, and officers took to the streets to knock on doors for her. Their intervention followed the indictment of four police officers by grand juries under Watkins’ oversight in 2014.

 Friendships, donations, fear of powerful police unions, fear of losing cases and being forced to face the repercussions. These are the hurdles that a prosecutor must overcome before criminally charging their police counterpart. It creates an apparent conflict of interest that often leads to an abnormally large margin of dismissed cases.

Yet it's only these people who demand that cops have no accountability and the freedom to be above the law. The total flip on the subject is bizarre and inconsistent with their values.


I'm not saying punish cops for mistakes, and I'm not saying I hate cops. We have issues and we should work to solve them, not stagnate and demand inaction. 


Hong Kong is literally protesting overreach by Xi. Blocking out all media and portraying the protesters exactly how the Right, here in the states, are portraying our own protesters.

1) how many other cops have as many complaints against them and are still cops? 

2) who reviewed all of these complaints against this cop and decided he could still be a cop?

3) were any of these complaints ever brought to the attention of the mayor or DA? If so, hold them accountable at the ballot.

4) these complaints should be reviewed by a committee that includes citizen representation.

If you really want to fix the system, start asking these kinds of questions of every mayor, chief of police and DA in every district and precinct across the nation.

AskReddit,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,gvj9a9,fspew1n,"I just want to say that as bad as police brutality is, I think that the American police still have their good points. Of course it has its flaws (I’m sure a lot of people have pointed it out), but it’s way better then the police force of most countries. At least the American police do their job and attempt to apprehend offenders, in my country (and a lot of other countries) the police side with, and try to, protect the offenders. I’m not saying the American police is flawless, but they’re still far better then the police force of most countries. 

Black Lives do matter, and I’m sure majority of the police force believes that. I’m also sure that a lot of policemen (and women) are equally saddened and angered by what happened to George Floyd. 

So in closing I do hope to the Americans reading, this that you’d appreciate your police force more. They’re not inherently bad and I’m sure that in times like this, they have their work cut out for them. I do hope they’ll receive some positivity from the American people in the midst of all this.

It took a while for it to sink in and for the effects to kick in. I had to drop out of University after nearly three years, completely depressed and I gained a ton of weight on medication - I literally went from being a conventionally attractive girl to someone who was very very overweight (although still in my opinion quite beautiful). 

I dropped out of University. I had a boyfriend but most of my friends disappeared. I had a breakdown and spent a night in a psych ward. 

I did everything I could do help myself after that. I got books on the internet that I knew could help me. I went to see a therapist. Twice a week, I got two buses and walked a long way to see the same therapist. I was huge from the meds and felt like such a failure but I just kept on going. I got a part time job which really helped me with my emotion regulation. I saved up money to go and see my boyfriend.

During the year I applied for new courses at university. However, in the ultimate act of humility I ended up going to continue the same degree at a much lower class university. I still had a good time.

There people didn't think much of me. I was overweight and still quite emotionally unstable. I was having symptoms from the trauma that affected me in a really bad public way. But I knew I was going somewhere.

I kept my head down and ran. Through all the humiliation and some bullying, I did my degree, even though my concentration was so bad from the trauma that I had to work all night every night and had no social life whatsoever. I went to more therapy. And when it went south, I went to more.

I finished that degree seemingly unable to live alone. However I found the subject I was truly passionate about and this motivated me to persevere. Instead of moving in back home, I proceeded to do TWO master's degrees. And by the way, I continued to have many public and humiliating symptoms and I nearly got kicked out of uni a couple of times cos they didn't like it and refused to understand but I kept on going.

Five years after dropping out I have two MSc's. I just landed my first job after 132 applications. I continued to attend therapy throughout the two Master's and I am doing do much better. I am still a bit curvy, but really, there are worse things in life, and it's kind of adorable.

Edit: getting over sexual trauma is one of the hardest things you can ever do, especially if it happened to you as a child. To have overcome this, while persevering with my studies to such a high degree, is to me to have continued moving forward.

Her twin was stuck in the NICU for four months that started at the beginning of COVID. Only my wife was allowed to see my daughter and I was stuck at home with a 9 year old and a 1 year old, both on the spectrum.

I became so stressed and depressed I put on that COVID weight and pretty much became a sloth. I never had the motivation to get up and do anything. I quit my job, dropped out of school, wasn’t sleeping, and the cycle of depression continued.

Then I got a counselor. I just wanted to talk about the stress of the NICU and the preemie baby. That evolved into seeing a doctor about my weight and potential health issues. Turns out my circadian rhythm is off, my upper jaw is preventing me proper air flow, and I was showing early signs of Hashimotos.

From there I started a new job where I walked a lot. I didn’t lose weight but I started to feel better about myself being active. Then I started exercising, 20-30 minutes a day. Now, I walk about 8-10 miles at work, exercise for 45 min a day, eat healthy, and generally feel great about life.

It’s not much but I was at my lowest point this year and the only thing stopping me from killing myself was my wife and kids.

In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.

Edit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O
Edit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event.

The Ottomans charged enormous taxes on goods passing through their territory, if they even let goods through at all. This led to Europeans looking for new trade routes. The Portuguese were already a pretty navally focused kingdom and were geographically situated the best to begin naval exploration. So they started trading down the West coast of Africa, eventually rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Sea. These expeditions allowed the Portuguese to develop their naval technology to the point where they could start venturing out into the Atlantic, beyond the sight of land and still reliably navigate. This led to the discovery of the Azores, which sparked a lot of interest in Europe. It was the first time in living memory new lands had been discovered.

Portugal's new trade wealth sparked competition with their newly united rival and Iberian peninsula neighbors, the Spanish Kingdoms. The Spanish began funding their own trade voyages to try to compete with Portugal, including, famously, a Genoese explorer named Christopher Columbus.

More than half a millennia later people descended from Europeans who colonized the lands Columbus ""discovered"" for Europe elected an orange fascist president. So I personally blame Mehmed II for Trump's election.",None,534,2020-10-14 14:37:38

AskReddit,"Women of reddit, what do you think about the fall of constantinople in 1453 by the ottoman forces led by Mehmed II?",jb1el5,g8sxszj,"The real reason why they ‘fell’ constantinople :

It wasn’t just to fall, it’s main reason was because that was the bridge which was connecting the eastern ottoman lands (middle east) to the western part (europe). They only had a connection through sea so they had to get a land connection. Also, the Byzantium there was getting solideres from Europe to attack several parts of the Ottomans, that way it had become the most important job for them. Many sultans before Mehmed II tried it but failed. Mehmed II was 17years old when he got a Sultan and was successful on taking in Constantinople with 21years.

AskReddit,"Women of reddit, what do you think about the fall of constantinople in 1453 by the ottoman forces led by Mehmed II?",jb1el5,g8t7yjd,"I am a woman, though I'm currently studying biomedical engineering and history is my weakest subject. I read through a couple of articles to develop some sort of understanding and opinion - I hope some woman with some more background will be able to provide an even better and more thorough answer, and I hope someone will tell me if I've said anything incorrect.

The City of Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire for a very long time - over 1000 years, and had survived many attacks up until this point. It had these extremely thick walls, and an army would have had to attack by both land and sea to even try to take it. However, some of these sieges over the years had decimated the population (400k in the 12th century and 40k-50k in the 1450's). Also, they were also losing their diplomatic power - the Popes/Roman Catholic Europe were not happy that they would not form a union with them, so no significant help could be expected.

Meanwhile, the Ottoman Turks had been extending their control over the Balkans and Anatolia, even several Byzantine cities. They had tried to capture Constantinople before (had to suppress an uprising elsewhere) and the new sultan, Mehmed II, had been preparing to try again.

The defenders were very weak at this point - only fewer than 5k men, which could not cover the city's walls. And technology had moved on - these walls were impenetrable up until that point, but this time, the attackers had cannons (large and heavy ones, and smaller ones that could fire more often), as well as 60k-80k men, as per modern historians. Constantine resisted for about 6 weeks, which was impressive! Though near to the end, chaos reigned - women and children were defending the walls, some of the defenders went back to defend their own families, many killed themselves rather than be subjected to the destruction that came immediately after and then after that.

The Hagia Sophia was converted into a Mosque, Constantinople became the new capital of the Ottoman Empire, and the city was repopulated with people from a multitude of faiths and backgrounds. The East had gained quite a bit of power over Christendom, and humanity had moved from the middle ages into the Renaissance.

Well, it happens. They had it coming for a while. I'm not sure what preventative measures they could have taken to keep this from happening, or how that would have impacted things.

The Fall of Constantinople was inevitable since basically the fourth crusade. Even looking back to the battle of manzikert, Byzantium was on a very slow decline. In terms of impacts, it was a disaster for Eastern Christians, with the destruction of relics and the dispersal of the religion itself, which can still be seen today as there are a variety of regional Orthodox Christian groups. However, it did prompt a westward move of knowledge, which was key in the rediscovery of texts in the Renaissance.

AskReddit,"Women of reddit, what do you think about the fall of constantinople in 1453 by the ottoman forces led by Mehmed II?",jb1el5,g8tcunq,"FINALLY! I can answer this.

Mehmed the II, I believe, tried to live up to his GrandFather, and Father's deeds. This blinded him during the long sieges on Constantinople.  Once he decided to use artillery in a way that had never been used before, there was no turning back. The Wolf and her cubs (Orban) not only provided drive for the exhausted troops, but also a distraction for the Turks inside the walls.  After suffering wounds himself, Mehmed and his advisors (who knows exactly whose idea it was first) decided to circumvent the Golden Horn, pull the boats out of the water, and place them back in on the other side of the boom chain.  The gig was up!  Morale fell inside the walls, and the best fighters knew it was over.

"" He rode immediately to the Hagia Sophia, He ordered to be protected. He transformed it into a Muslim Mosque, solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.""

Mehmed completed his Grandfather and father's wish. He didn't stop there!  He successfully defended Constantinople  and led conquests throughout the surrounding lands. Morea, Trebizond,  I liked reading about the Ottoman-Venetian War.

&#x200B;

Now, what I think about it.  Throughout history we see large significant battles and huge stories to go with it.  I like that I can really get to the Micro history of Mehmed himself. I sorely wish I could travel back and be a fly on the wall during these times.  Throughout the history of Humanity, we have fought for land in the name of a God or Gods.

When do we start to fight for Humanity? Would it even be ""fighting"" if no one died?",Jkerb_was_taken,13,2020-10-14 17:29:06

Anyway the phone rings, and the person who answered started listing off names. Sorting my cards for another round of Presidents and Assholes I offhandedly said “heh and Darrell!”.

For High School, I received an academic scholarship to a private Catholic school. it was a really big deal for my family.  I didn't know anyone at the new school. between an odd combination of academics, sports and the tail end of puberty, I became very popular in this new school. I wasn't used to the attention and it definitely got to my teenage head.  Nearly all of my social circles became around the new school and not with my old local friends.  

  

I'm in my junior year, I head to a McDonalds for lunch with a few friends from the new school. working the counter, I see a girl who i used to go to public school with that I used to have a crush on. She just lit up when she saw me, she was so excited, and I ... I was a shitty teenager and I just ignored her. I pretended I didn't recognize her. She looked so deflated when I didn't acknowledge her.   

  

Note this was the 90's.  My family moved a few times after that. I settled down in a different part of the country after University.  I never made it back to that town.  I've relived that asshole moment for years now. Fast forward to one of those nights when I relive that moment, and I decide to look her up on Facebook to apologize.

Thing is, I was so nervous that I spaced out for a bit and got lost in my overthinking mind, so I didn't hear the teacher's questions to my classmates. When it got to my turn, the teacher just said ""Now tell me about you"", assuming I understood what kind of information he was expecting. I just went straight into a monologue that started with ""So I was born in the South Zone of the city, but my mom decided to move to our current neighborhood a few months after divorcing my dad..."" And went on and on giving some very specific details about my short life. Everyone had a really confused look on their faces and as soon as I realized the teacher was also completely lost I stopped talking and went instantly red.

The teacher then said ""that's all really great, but I was only interested in what happened last year, not the last 10..."", and everyone started laughing.

One of my coworkers was a guy my age who went to a different school. He was really cute, but he had a girlfriend who was away at college, and besides, I was in no position to date.

Meanwhile, ThE lOvE oF mY lIfE had broken up with me, but I didn't want him to know how much he had hurt me, so I was determined to have a date to the homecoming dance.

I thought of my coworker who was good looking and because he went to another school, no one would have to know my love life was crap and I had a friend take me to the dance. I asked him if he'd go with me, as friends, but somehow the wires got crossed and he thought I was actually asking him out.

After work one day, he asked if he could talk to me and he went into this long speech about how he has a girlfriend and he loves her very much and he can't disrespect her by going to the dance with me. All of that was fine--I wasn't mad or anything--except I'm a stress-laugher, and it struck me as funny that he thought I wanted to date him when the reality was that I didn't want to date anyone except ThE lOvE oF mY lIfE. Of course, all of that is difficult to explain as a mature adult, let alone a 17-year-old girl, so I just laughed.

AskReddit,How would you feel about a ban of “how would you feel” questions on the sub?,eio3qj,fct8lgi,"Like you're sweeping your own legs out from under you. As you ban more types of questions, you narrow down the types of questions that can be asked. Guess what's likely to happen? Some other type of question becomes a predominant and annoying one. You ban that, another one pops up. You do this enough and the questions just get more and more narrow, and more and more annoying.

The primary problem with repetition in this sub is that reality can't keep up. There are only so many ways to ask interesting questions and many of the people who could come up with interesting things to ask are too busy doing other things to come on reddit.

As long as reddit threads have a half-life of roughly 6 hours, subreddits are going to struggle greatly with staying interesting. And that's the threads that get tons of upvotes. The ones in new have a half-life of probably minutes, if not seconds, depending on content flow. Unless they catch into rising, which will give them a bit more time, but not much.

The intrigue is in the answers and the discussions, for the most part. Rarely the questions themselves. But when threads die off so fast, it makes it difficult for people to sink their teeth into a meaty discussion. So you get puns or cheesy stories instead.",None,4,2020-01-02 03:29:27

It’s like a stroganoff or something I guess, the recipe is one can of cheap cream of mushroom soup, one of those 80cent things of sour cream, the empty soup can full of milk, a dash of 1$ steak sauce, seasoning and cheap ground beef over noodles. Costs just a couple bucks to make and feeds an entire family of four

Editing to add the full recipe 


I use Goya season all, and I generally put it over farfalle noodles but fettuccini works really well tho

So the general recipe I follow is as follows Brown ground meat with salt and pepper with a dash of Worcestershire sauce Once that’s browned add in a can of cream of mushroom and a duck huge dollop of sour cream, fill the fan with milk and add that too. Then some more Worcestershire sauce, some a1, and like a tablespoon of your favorite mustard. Season to taste with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and whatever else you think sounds good. Serve over noodles. I also suggest putting some Parmesan cheese over it when you eat it cause it’s good.",SkeeveTheGreat,6734,2020-08-09 16:37:47

I would ask her where it hurts, what kind of pain, what symptoms she has, to help diagnose what the problem is. 

I would tell her we are doing these things to help her stay healthy, so she can home soon. I feel so bad she can't understand why we are doing procedures on her and why she is in a strange place, but that it is to help her get better. Please don't fight us and please take your pills, you need them to get better.

I would make sure she knows just what she means to us, and how much we love her and miss her. I can't sleep properly without her on my hip, snoring away. 
I miss her following us around constantly and announcing her presence as she enters a room. 

She is such a special girl. The cats are my life and I don't know what I'd do if I lost them.

Turning the camera from the footage onto the audience, you need only look at their faces to feel their grief and shame.

AskReddit,[Breaking News] Orlando Nightclub mass-shooting.,4nqnrm,d461xbo,"They're reporting that the shooter is an angered Muslim who did this because he saw 2 men kissing earlier this week. I feel bad for everyone involved but this story is going to get spun like a top. Every time a story like this happens, people think that as long as they can lay the blame at the foot of one group or another that that will somehow ease the pain. There's no fix for crazy and no group has a monopoly on them.

Edit: To all the people that are calling me out for being a Muslim apologist, I'm pasting a snippet from one of my posts below because it will get more visibility here and hopefully curtail further replies of the same sentiment.

It's not Islam, any more than it was Christianity when Christians do it. The problem is **Islamism** - which, in short, is the movement to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life. We're doing the religion a great disservice by not calling out the problem. You are right though - it is a hard thing to communicate and we need to start doing so, and not cloak the conversation by focusing on the religion rather than the people that seek to implement a very narrow minded version of it globally. You seem genuine in your convictions and it's good to see that, so I please ask you (and anyone else that comes across this) to watch the video below. It's powerful and hopefully it will spark the right conversation.

- Fifty people are now known to have died

- 53 people were injured

- Officials said the killings were likely to be ideologically motivated, though there was no information that the gunman was associated with a particular group

- The suspect - Omar Mateen (dead), who was a US citizen from the Florida town of Port St Lucie and was of Afghan descent, was not on a terrorism watch list, although he was being investigated for an unrelated criminal act.



edit 2: How the incident unfolded

* The attack began at about 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), said Police Chief John Mina.
* Pulse, which is one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, Florida, was holding a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire inside.

* Shortly afterwards, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running."" 
* Police sources have told US media the gunman was in possession of a suspicious device strapped to his body.
* There was an exchange of fire with a police officer working at the club, but it is unclear whether that was inside or outside the venue.
* A hostage situation developed and at 05:00 local time (09:00 GMT), officers stormed the building and detonated a ""controlled explosion"".

Everyone is so concerned about the ethnicity and affiliation of the shooter. It's a bit ridiculous. There have been a lot of police, fire department, paramedics, and other heroes that served us today. And I bet you that you could find one white man and one Muslim among them. One Trump supporter, one Hillary supporter, one Bernie supporter, and one political apathetic. One person pro-gun rights, one person pro-gun control. Straight, gay, transgendered, etc. So stop your petty bickering and ""hoping"" for a certain outcome here.


If your immediate response to any tragedy is hope in the name of some agenda, your priorities are so far out of line. That's walking a gray area between a real human being, and a monster capable of committing this atrocity in the first place.

I know a ton of blood went to waste after 9/11 because of so many people donating in the following days 


EDIT: I get it guys, it only takes ~48 hours to get blood ready, this blood is to replenish what was used to treat the victims and it sucks that the red cross doesn't let dudes that have had gay sex before donate blood. Below is a citation on the 9/11 comment but it's been made clear to me that it's a different situation in orlando and since it's summer, they're already pretty low and could use the influx of donors anyways.

Bloating and swelling due to high sodium intake, or drinking alcohol the day before could make your face look a bit bigger.

How hydrated you are and how well you slept will also affect your skin and darkness under your eye, as well as puffiness under the eye. 

your body and stomach can always change due to bloating or just not taking a shit. 

Your face can also wear the outline of the last expression you were holding for a long while, be it resting bitch face, a look of worry or stress, or anger. 

All of this stuff can fluctuate throughout the day and week greatly and frankly thats normal.

They run towards each other and start gabbing on like teenagers do, this is where the fun starts...


The friend's dad an I look at each other then burst out with a high pitched scream and run towards each other into an enthusiastic embrace. Some of the comments we made are as follows:


""OMG, you look fab!""
""Oh, it's all you bae!""
""What have you done to your hair? I LOVE it!""
etc...


We are both 35-40yo grown men carrying on about how good the other looks and all the rest of it. The blood drained from both daughters' faces and you could literally see them thinking ""just kill me now...""


It was glorious! 10/10 would recommend



EDIT: First gold!! Thanks reddit, does that mean I win the internets today?!?


EDIT 2: The other dad and I know each other from a local church and we are both jokers. It was a cosmic alignment thing... On another note, I wore a topknot in public today to further embarrass them. Being a dad rocks!!",asparien,16041,2018-01-10 03:47:45

AskReddit,"What do you think of the idea of ""adopting"" elderly people whose children have died as parents or grandparents, much the same way we adopt children whose parents have died as our own?",imbb4r,g3yisjv,"There is actually a program that kind of meets this need where I live. People can sign up for a ‘rented’ grandparent. It allows families that have no living grandparents or no or limited contact with the grandparents to have grandparents in their life. 

It helps elderly people who want social contact and it helps families who want their children to experience grandparents. 

How you interact with the ‘rented’ grandparents is up to you and your ‘rented’ grandparent. So if you want to do a lot together, they match you with someone who wants to be very active. If you want someone more laid back they match you with a laidback person

Edit: They are called 'rental' or 'borrowed' grandparents. You don't actually pay to spend time with them. Should have probably clarified that.

She'd have Sunday lunch with us and we'd pop into each others houses for a cuppa. She was like a mother to me and hubby. She had children of her own but they lived abroad so she only saw them a couple of times a year.

I've been morbidly obese for as long as I can remember due to bad eating habits and being sedentary. I've lost 62 pounds in the past three to four months from forming healthy eating habits, eating balanced meals, and getting plenty of exercise.

Edit: Thank you so much for all of the encouraging words and awards. I got started by getting screened for mental illnesses by a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD and was put on a non stimulant medication. It's been the most life changing experience. That internal voice that talks you out of doing something is barely around anymore and I've finally started developing habits and routines that benefit me with little struggle.

Also I found an indoor recumbent exercise bike which is one of the greatest things for people who want to get a good workout that isn't hard on the back and knees. Plus the ability to watch something on my laptop while I do it is awesome.

Last but not least I keep track of my eating and exercise using MyFitnessPal.",professional_burrito,19627,2019-12-18 13:57:11

Things my parents did, I will repeat: 

* My dad kept me away from ads as a kid by taping cartoons and letting me watch them without the advertisement.  I am certain this had a major change on my development.  Therefore, set up a Plex server where I can give junior me access to all the shows and he wants -- ad free.
* Spend lots of early time teaching and enriching.  Sit with him to work on homework.  Math was hard for me, it will be hard for junior me.  Never breathe a word of dyslexia or any kind of excuse.  Just some daily flash exercises for the routine stuff.  I will 100% take time off work for this if I have to, which I have the luxury of doing.

Things my I would do differently than my parents:

* We can skip the religion phase
* No ""finish everything on your plate"" nonsense - full means full
* Focus more on physical exercise, even if its something ""weird and foreign"" like martial arts
* No shaming about sex, be willing to talk openly and provide a safe environment for questions",wayoverpaid,124,2019-12-18 19:13:18

AskReddit,"78% of suicide rates world wide are men, what can we do to help them?",etcyd6,fffw3r9,"Statistically speaking men work more, work longer hours, work in more dangerous professions and consume more drugs (alcohol and other). In addition men, on average, have fewer close friends and feel lonelier than women. I think the fatigue of such a life can be quite draining. 

I don't think the problem is that men do not talk about their feelings. I think the problem is that they often don't have someone to talk to. 
In addition, it can be quite hard to make new friends. Especially when you are past your twenties. You know, people you are potentially interested in are married and have kids. They are preoccupied with their own lives. 

I felt very lonely and sad after my last long term relationship ended. It took me over 6 months to find new friends and I'm a hardcore extrovert. Still, I made a bunch of new friends within the past year or so.

It's become worse in recent years as we literally have to tiptoe around while being blamed for everything generations before us supposedly did. Most men alive today had no part in anything that was done to others.

You want to help, then create an environment for men equal to that of everyone else instead of dwelling on the doings of long dead people and putting men seperate and last.  The thing about equality is that EVERYONE is equal regardless of gender, sexuality and age etc.

AskReddit,"78% of suicide rates world wide are men, what can we do to help them?",etcyd6,fffu1cu,"I think a big part of it is a sense of purpose.


Increasingly, the work we do doesn't produce such apparent results.  For instance, a man used to go into the woods and hunt an animal.  It was very difficult, but when he came home with meat, his family could eat and everyone was thankful that they aren't eating soup again.  Everyone loves dad.


But today, a man might go into the office, input some data, crunch some numbers, sign some paperwork... But what is he doing?  Does his wife and kids appreciate it?  Not as much.


And it's not just work.  Men used to mow their lawn, change their oil, repair things around the house, etc.  But now all of that stuff is hired out to others.



The result is that they don't feel useful or appreciated.  And if they aren't useful, what is their purpose?


It's kind of like generating vs consuming content.  If you sit and watch YouTube all day every day, you will start to feel like a pretty worthless piece of shit.  But if you *create* YouTube videos, you would feel like you're doing something.  Like you have a purpose.  That applies to life in general.  People are increasingly consuming more and creating less.



I have noticed that when I start to feel down and depressed it's because of this.  It's usually when I haven't had any little ""wins"" in my life and I have just been kind of floating through and going through the motions.


If I let that go for too long, I could see how it could lead to deep dark depression.



So what can we do?  Women, show your men affection and appreciation.  Even if they don't do much good, at least show appreciation for the little good they do to motivate them to do better and grow.  And men, do something.  Help out around the house, fix something, draw something, do something nice for your partner or your kids, learn another language, learn a musical instrument, build something..... Just be productive and try to limit the time you are *consuming*. (TV, video games, browsing the internet, reading fiction, social media, etc)   You'll feel much more accomplished and healthy when you have more to offer the world, those around you, and yourself.",B0h1c4,3808,2020-01-24 18:49:46

2. Early education in personality psychology. There should be a course starting in 9th grade about the big 5 personality model and how your idiosyncrasies as a person contribute to your mental health. Big change when I learned about this at the age of 30.

3. Stop with the patriarchy and man hating nonsense. Most men are not in the 1%. It sucks when you're told you oppress people just by existing. Like dude, I'm 500$ away from being homeless and have no friends, wtf are you even talking about.

It seems to me that it's semi universally embraced to try to correct unfairness against women, but don't you dare speak out against unfairness to men. 

I was taking to my wife the other day about something I noticed at work. I'm a not conventionally attractive guy, and through the couple years I worked at this job, I noticed that all of the single younger women were somewhat cold to me. One word answers, not smiling, that kind of thing. (I am monogamous and was happily taken this whole time, i never said anything even slightly flirtatious. Just tried to have general chit chat while i fixed their computers.)

Suddenly after getting married (which was announced to everyone at work), all of these women were willing to speak to and be friendly back to me. I mean, ALL of them. It caught me off guard. They ask me questions now. We have actual conversations. Complete 180°.

My wife and I think this is because they were trying to avoid friendliness so I wouldn't hit on them, as they've likely had experiences with that kind of thing in the past. 

Can we all agree that this paradigm is a problem for both genders? I met my wife in high school, I was one of the lucky ones. Imagine being a less-than-attractive guy WITHOUT a partner, and they only available women *literally* refuse to talk to you (through no fault of your own)  I was 100% workspace etiquette appropriate and was still met with that response, so isn't always an issue of the guy being creepy or forward. 

No wonder so many guys get depressed, or so many go down the dark road of red pill bullshit. It doesn't matter how much of a ""good personality"" you have if they don't treat you like a person.

It's time to break that cycle and have fathers show their sons and daughter that it's okay to feel all da emotions. That it's okay to cry, it's okay to be vulnerable and open up about your struggles. 

\- Accepting that men can also be victims of physical/emotional abuse and rape, and providing as much support for them as we do for women. 

\- LISTEN TO EACH OTHER, it's pointless telling men to open up about their feelings if no one is there to take them seriously.

Edit: thank you so much for the gold! I’m finding the discussion in the replies so interesting and am so glad to be a part of it. You people raised some great points, I’ll reply later but just to clear up a few things...

When I say let men cry and show feelings, I do not mean they need to start crying and mull over every little thing. All I’m saying is that there needs to be a healthy balance between expressing and regulating your emotions. Everyone has different coping mechanisms. Yes, at times it’s necessary to “just suck it up”, to do what you gotta do. However, it’s not healthy to just suppress every negative emotion (Something that’s still often encouraged in our society). Not only does this cause things to build up, eventually destroying your mental health, but also, it inhibits you from learning how to communicate your feelings (good and bad) to people. 
If something hurts, then it fucking hurts. If it upsets you to the point of tears, that’s okay! Let it all out, there’s no shaming here! Girlfriend broke up with you and you need to just talk it out? Call up your friend! Tell them how this really sucks and how they can support you. Don’t feel like talking to anyone about it? That’s okay too! Let your friends know that you’re going through a hard time and you can fill them in later if you want to, after you’ve had your time alone. 

In short, let’s break down those outdated gender norms and start using those healthy coping mechanisms, cheers!",TopClassTrier,839,2020-01-24 20:50:01

If you know how to actually *feel* the things you're experiencing then when shit gets hard you can deal with it easier. Otherwise you're left with a sense of discomfort, a nauseating sickening twisting in your gut and a sense that *something* is wrong. You're not sure what, just that things aren't right and you need it to stop right now. You drink, you punch the wall, you hurt yourself. You try to cry but tears don't come because all you know about crying is, ""Man up."" ""Grow up."" ""Boys don't cry.""

You try to tell people you're not okay, a shrug when they ask how things are going. Telling people who care about you, you're not feeling so great or are having a bad week. But the lacklustre way, that is the only way, you feel comfortable talking about how you feel doesn't draw the help it needs, and why would it.. or should it? You're a man, you shouldn't ask for help, or even *need* it. You deal with these things alone because you're a rock, a pillar of support, the one who stays calm when things go wrong.

So instead of unloading, or dealing with the issues they get carried, bottled up, pushed down, hidden. You desensitise yourself to them however you can and remain stoic. But eventually even stone crumbles and when it does it's too late. There's too much, it's overwhelming. You don't even know where to start, the only thing you know is you want it to stop, *need* it to stop.

AskReddit,"78% of suicide rates world wide are men, what can we do to help them?",etcyd6,ffg1kk1,"Here’s something.

Men are continually being told by women (mostly) to shun all forms of “toxic” masculinity. Now don’t get me wrong, actual toxic masculinity insofar as domestic abuse and *actual* harmful behavior is very bad, but when you start villainizing traditional masculinity that’s where things start to get hairy.

Men are also told by women to be sensitive, express their feelings, and it is *implied* that this means being generally submissive and meek, though it is not stated outright. 

Here’s where things get problematic.

When men believe they possess these characteristics, i.e. “I’m a *nice* guy, I’m considerate, I listen, I’m *woke*. Why won’t women date me?” Well friend, it’s because women generally *want* one thing, but are biologically hardwired (thanks evolution) to want another. 

Despite our high minded ideals of social justice and the fact that we are “special,” we are just like every other animal. Procreation is the name of the game! Through evolution, women are attracted to men who are capable. This is why wealthy, powerful, and muscular men tend to copulate more often than poor, weak men. On the flip side, men are attracted to women who are biologically superior in caring for their potential children. Hence, why we’re attracted to large breasts, and nice round, healthy posteriors. This is why these women tend to copulate more than women who don’t possess these characteristics.

It’s simple biology folks, yet we keep trying to act like it’s not.

Back to the suicide issue, men are not feeling valued as much as they used to. Possibly due to economic reasons, or lack of romantic opportunities. How do we stop or reverse the trend? Stop villainizing men first (looking at you Buzzfeed), second let men know they are needed in society, and encourage men to pursue the things that make them happy.",El_Duderino_Brevity,163,2020-01-24 20:07:46

AskReddit,"What are subtle red flags at a job interview that say ""working here would suck""?",kttvdy,gio2xr3,"I came in for a job interview at 7:30 PM. The entire staff was still in the office. Should have known right then that 9 to 5 was not ever going to happen. One day I worked until 2:30 AM to finish up a big project, and my boss said to me I could come in an hour later the next morning. Gee thanks bro, with my public transport/travel time that gives me a solid 2 hours of sleep instead of just the one.

EDIT - With all the stories in the reactions on this post, I just wanted to say that there really are good employers out there. Do not stand by being treated so poorly, because you deserve to be treated with respect. For any employers reading this thread, here’s a few examples of how to create a loyal, healthy employee base:

My current employer puts family first. If there is an emergency at home, they tell you to handle that first. For example when I was miscarrying they told me “I don’t want to see you in the next two weeks at least, take your time and give me a call when you feel ready to come back in, ok?”

9-5 means 9-5. If you have to leave early for something or come in later bc of something, they expect you to take your own responsibility (and don’t even check if you actually catch up the lost time, they just expect that you do). By doing so you create that on the rare occassion that you do have to stay late to finish something, you do that without complaining, because it only happens incidentally and not structurally (and certainly isn’t expected, in fact, they ask if you REALLY have to stay late or if you just THINK you have to stay late). If you both give and take, you’re much more likely to give back. 

They frequently and _genuinely_ ask about your wellbeing. And then also follow that up. If you tell them your mother is unwell, they ask about her a week later. It’s not lost in the abyss that is business, no, you feel SEEN and HEARD. “You look stressed. Is there anything I can do? Do you want to go over your to-do list together and prioritize what needs done first?” Things like this mean the WORLD. One time they walked in and said “Hey, my afternoon meeting got cancelled, I know you have like 15 files that need checking and I’ve seen how full your calendar is, why don’t you give me 4 and I’ll make sure they get sent out today, to lighten your load a little”. 

They focus on little tokens of appreciation. A chocolate easter bunny waiting on your desk at Easter (last year they hid 10 easter eggs in every room, I found one hidden in the box of my crackers hahaha), they make sure your salary is paid before Christmas even though you normally don’t get paid before the 26th, they make sure every secretary gets flowers on Secretary-day, they bought us weird pens (think bright neon color with dangly beads on top) just because they thought it would brighten up our days. Like, it only costs a penny, but it makes your staff feel seen. When there’s a heatwave, they treat us with popsicles. When it’s holiday season, they randomly decide to close the office at noon on Dec 31st “if we have to earn it in the last couple of hours of this day we’re doing something wrong. So let’s shut down for the day, have a good one guys”. 

They do not tolerate gossip. We talk WITH eachother, not about eachother. They hire capable staff, people who are not putting in the work/effort do not last. They will ask us about peoples progress, like “what do you think about the new receptionist?” and we can answer frankly, even if our opinion is that they’re not making enough progress etc. They want to know what we think and they value our input. This creates a healthy work environment, with driven people who all have heart for the “cause”. 

Mistakes are human, and we solve them together without smacktalking about the person responsible. Of course we all have our bad days and it’s ok to mope and murmle here and there to your roommate, but we really try to keep that to an absolute minimum.",Miss-Impossible,26170,2021-01-09 16:47:00

She said they would call me to reschedule some time the next week. I told her I was currently unavailable M-W but could come in any time Th-F. She said if I couldn't make time for the interview, I probably wouldn't be a good fit. I said okay, and went on to my other interviews and ending up working elsewhere.

2) The paystubs were obviously designed to be confusing. They were a full page and absolutely covered in data. He wanted me to be impressed by a dollar amount (obviously not accounting for costs which the contractor has to carry or taxes which the contractor has to deduct and pay) but he took them away before anyone could have deciphered what the pay period, piece rate, number of jobs or kms was.

3) He showed me other people paystubs! wtf??

(The job was at a psychiatric hospital).  I thanked her for being honest with me and said that I was not interested.  As she was walking me out, she leaned in and said, ""you're doing the right thing.  Our last hire quit because he said he was having palpitations all the time here and was worried he would have a heart attack.""  

About 3 years later, at another company, I saw one of the women who had interviewed me.  She worked in a totally different position in a totally different setting.  She said that the other woman who had interviewed me, the one who gave me the warning actually DID suffer a heart attack!  She survived, and she stopped working there.   I was so thankful she warned me.  Most interviewers wouldn't do that.

Edit: and in thinking more about that woman, obviously SHE was very stressed and SHE was having to cover work for that position that needed to be filled.  She could have easily (and understandably) have gone into survival mode and thought ""you know what, let's just hire her [meaning me] and then at least I will have some relief for a month or two until this one quits too."" 

But she didn't do that, she thought of my welfare, a stranger, over her own interests. And clearly, she was suffering.    I would have relocated for that job too, about 150 miles.

AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhfmi2f,"I am a bartender but happened to be the one on the date for this particular disaster. 

So anyone in the service industry knows, you generally just do not make plans on certain holidays because you will have to work, no matter what. I had not had a date on Valentine's in probably 7 years, so when my boss gave me the day off I was surprised and posted something dumb on insta about it. I got a DM from a girl I knew but not very well, asking me out for Valentines and she was way cute so I figured why the fuck not.

Things went so wrong, so quickly. We get to the restaurant, grab a drink in the bar while we wait on our table, took a shot to get the social lubricant flowing since we dont really know each other very well. I pay our bar tab, and we move to the table.

To set the scene a bit, this place is a really nice steakhouse and they have these dark red, diamond pattern booths that are fluffy, with buttons at each point of the pattern. Hard to explain but it looked something like this:
 https://centralseating.com/classic-diamond-button-back-dining-booth-with-side-walls-and-curved-top-b1043.html

The moment we sit down, my date lets out a blood curdling scream like she had just been stabbed. She grabs her arm and her hand comes away covered in blood, and she looks so confused and I have no idea what the fuck just happened. I look around thinking someone just stabbed her but everyone around us is seated just staring over at us. I move over to her side of the booth and grab the napkins off the table to find where she is cut. The entire back of her upper arm is sliced from elbow to shoulder. One of the buttons had broken off of the wall and the snapped metal fastener was exposed so when she sat down her arm ran all the way down along it. 

She is panicking, I am trying to stop the bleeding, while the people around us figure out what is going on and call 911 for us. The manager comes over and is immediately a defensive asshole until he sees that it was his booth that did the damage. The paramedics show up, I get the owners info from the manager, and we spend the night in the ER where she needed something like 80 stitches. 

We both are exhausted at this point, when a guy walks in with flowers, champagne and a bag of takeout food from the restaurant we had left. It was the owner of the restaurant coming to make sure we could have the Valentines meal we had missed out on. Sure it was probably because he was afraid to get sued but it was still really welcomed after how shitty the night had become, so quickly. 

She and I ended up dating for almost 3 years and became good friends with the owner. Such good friends she ended up banging him and that was the last I heard from either of them. Woo, Valentines. I have stuck to working those nights ever since.

The end.

Edit: I would like to sincerely thank the people going through my comment history and messaging me things like ""maybe if you didn't play so many video games like a manchild then you wouldn't get cucked."" You guys are making my fucking night and it is hilarious. How dare people enjoy things!

Had a table of two people, probably in their mid 40s last year. Took 45 minutes for this couple to get their entrees due to our kitchen being way too slammed. When they were dropped at the table, they immediately asked for to-go boxes because they told their babysitter they’d be home by a certain time. I overheard the wife say “well I guess this is why we don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day”. The worst part was that they weren’t angry, just... very sad. 

My personal feelings about dining out on Valentine’s Day aside, I felt so horrible that this couple clearly had put in an effort to have a nice night with each other only to have it go that way. (We comp’d their meals, btw).


EDIT to clear up some timing issues. I should’ve added more context to this the first time but wanted to keep it simple. They made a reservation but unfortunately got seated about 10 minutes late, they ordered a round of drinks while looking over the menu, then a salad course, and THEN entrees.

AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhfcc1r,"I was a waitress many moons ago, and two couples spring to mind. The first were an older couple who were dressed nicely. They were polite and cordial to me, but not overly enthusiastic or friendly.

Every time I went over to their table, the atmosphere felt like I’d walked straight into an argument, but they weren’t speaking, or looking at each other or anything. It very quickly became awkward as fuck. 

The second couple was meant to be having a proposal dinner. The guy had rung to book a table, and had let us know he was going to propose during dessert. He’d given the ring to kitchen staff so we could bring it out with a cake, and he’d got some balloons and streamers too. Anyway, he walks in a couple of steps behind his partner - everyone has big grins for them both - but he grits his teeth and shakes his head, surreptitiously dragging his finger across his throat pantomime style. Great. Oh, and lucky me, they’re seated in my section. It’s obvious she was bloody furious with him about something; she spends the first half of the meal seething quietly, and the second having a constant pop at him.

AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhfoyp6,"I worked at a pretty high end Mediterranean Bistro, my second Valentine's there it was probably the busiest night I've ever worked as a server. We had reservations that booked basically the entire restaurant including the bar and patio from 4 P.M to 11:00 P.M. No walk-ins were to be seated unless a reservation was cancelled, or someone with a reservation didn't show up.

Most of the customers were pretty understanding and either waited or simply left. One dude however kept pushing and pushing asking every 10 minutes how much longer until he is seated, constantly saying how he is a regular customer; and how his date is going to be there at 7 (he got there at 6). We insisted that once a table was available, and all the customers before him we're seated, he would get a table, but because the amount of reservations we couldn't guarantee he would even get a table at all. At about 6:50 the guy loses it, fast-walks up to the hostess stand where the reservation book is, grabs the reservation book and practically runs out the front door.

Now everything is going to complete shit because the only copy of the reservations for the night that is barely half over is gone. Two of the owners ran outside to follow the guy and try and get the book back, but by the time they got out he had already left the parking lot. Even better is, two hours later, chaos is still running rampant and the dude shows back up saying he has a reservation for two. Three of the five of the owners (all brothers) escorted the dude and his date out to the parking lot and banned him from the restaurant permanently. They even took a picture of him and posted it in the window saying ""Do Not Serve This Man""

The drunk girlfriend refused to believe this story, so the woman showed her his Tinder profile and their conversation. The boyfriend returned to a drunk, sobbing and screaming girlfriend. 

I felt like I was watching a reality tv show, it was incredible. The poor girl was basically carried out of the bar by her boyfriend of 3 years whom she just discovered has been cheating on her for who knows how long. It was the most dramatic moment I have ever experienced and it was absolutely none of my business.

EDIT: I was a bar-back at the time and this couple sat directly in front of the place I spend most of my time, the glass washing station.

EDIT 2: For those wondering how the woman knew the couple was in a long-term relationship. I really don’t know. My guess is she figured it out the same way I did, based on listening, body language and the fact that this woman was overly touchy and liberal with cheek kisses and such. It was fairly obvious. Regardless, she approached out of concern and curiosity and she succeeded in outing the guy which resulted in a very upsetting scene.",t97brandt,15535,2020-02-12 22:49:13
AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhfo1ek,"I was working for a higher end chain steakhouse in the North West corner of greater Los Angeles (in the valley). Valentines is obviously one of the top 5 busiest days of the year for us, we did about 500 covers between 5 and 10 PM. It’s also a restaurant with a very open concept floor plan. Booths along the 4 walls of the restaurant and an array of tables in the middle with no partitions or anything between them.   A younger couple (maybe mid 20’s) dressed to the nines came in shortly after we opened and were seated in a table basically in the dead center of the dining room. They were very friendly and pleasant and I could tell that for them, dining at our restaurant was a really special treat so I did everything in my power to make it special for them. When they’re done, probably around 7, I brought their check which was around $300. When I came back to pick it up the guy had a super embarrassed look on his face and he said he thinks he left his wallet in the car and the woman, who is embarrassed for him, doesn’t have anything with her because her dress had no pockets and she didn’t bring a purse. So he goes out and 5 minutes later comes back in looking pale as a ghost. He has left his wallet at home and asks if he can call back later with payment info. My GM won’t let this fly because there’s no collateral of any sort he can leave, so the guy has to drive home TO BURBANK to get his wallet while the woman waits, with her hair done and her red lipstick and her pretty dress, In The middle of the dining room on Valentine’s Day. Now, on the best day with no traffic (never happens) it’s at least 40 minutes each way from our restaurant to Burbank. She was there for almost 2 hours waiting for this guy. We were all so embarrassed for her that the staff kept discreetly slipping her drinks and little amuse bouche bites from the kitchen. It was one of the most awkward things I’ve ever seen in a restaurant.   When he finally got back he was super apologetic to us and to her, he paid the check and tipped like 30% and they left. It was pretty obvious it was an honest mistake but I still think about that couple from time to time and wonder how things worked out for them.

AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhflz5t,"Depends on who you ask as to wether or not this is a disaster. 

Place I worked at in college was a pretty nice establishment and a romantic destination because our view overlooked the entire city. 

It was also located at the top of a five star hotel that had several projectors cycling through what was going on around the hotel in the lobby. There was no footage from the gym or pool so it was relatively tame and never a privacy issue. Best you’d ever get were people eating, walking around the lobby or drinking at the bar. 

Anyway guy walks in with his wife and asked to be seated in a secluded area. Well you can imagine since it’s busy and Valentine’s Day we didn’t have those, so he basically waited an extra hour to make sure he was seated in the back corner. 

It’s my section, I take their drink order and take care of them though the husband was gone when I returned and I didn’t see him go to the bathroom.

Thinking nothing of it I go to the bar to get the drink and see ALL of my coworkers huddled around the monitor above the bar along with everyone else in there. Sure enough I found the husband as he was underneath the table going down on his wife. 

Only problem was the camera above their table had a clear view because it was situated in the corner. 

So now the entire hotel lobby can see as it cycles between us in the bar laughing, people checking in and our romantic couple dining on each other. 

More and more people start to notice and the bar fills up. This includes back of the house staff like dishwashers and the line cooks. Eventually it also brings out my manager who runs over to their table, tells them what happened and they both run out mortified. 

But before they do the husband tries to stand up too quickly and flips the table, ruining all the plates while also exposing that his fly was down and his dick is out. 

He’s yelling at my manager, the hotel manager (who came up when he saw it in the lobby) and security unzipped as he’s escorted out. 

So yes disaster for them but man they made a lot of people laugh that night",whereegosdare84,13276,2020-02-12 22:22:04

AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhfofxk,"16 years in hospitality gives you some good stories.

The most awkward:

My first job as a waitress a guy wanted to propose to his girlfriend. He came in 2 months before to book and had everything figured out. He planned to pop the question during dessert. We had champagne, balloons and sparklers prepped for the big moment. The time comes, he drops to one knee gives a speech about his love for her. He asks, she says no, puts the ring in her bag, finishes her dessert and leaves. Quite possibly the most awkward thing I have had to witness (alongside around 200 other people.) The manager gave him everything for free he felt that bad for him. Cringed inside every time I saw him after that.

The most fucked up:

I was working as a duty manager and one of the tills kept dropping off the network. As I was trying to fix it I could clearly hear the conversation of the table by the waiters station. It started out sweet enough with her excitedly telling him she was pregnant. He went quiet and didn't say anything for a bit and then asked her what the plan was. She said she was keeping the baby. He said he didn't want kids and had told her this. She got upset and said she thought he'd be happy and change his mind when he found out. (By this point I've fixed the till, but am unable to step away from this car crash.) Turns out she stopped taking the pill without telling him thinking she could turn him around. He said he knew she could be a little nuts sometimes but this was next level. He told her it was over and she could send someone to collect her things as he wanted nothing more to do with her. He called me over to pay the bill and just left. The guy never even shouted, he just calmly went fuck this and noped out of there. I couldn't even look her in the eye, just left her to leave in her own time.

The funniest:

Managing hotel room service where there was a valentines package that included getting each course of the special menu delivered to your room. More than a few couples thought it was a good idea to call for the next course and then start having sex. Having to help with deliveries as reception fucked up the bookings; I had the 'privilege' of people answering the door naked, seeing sex toys strewn around and one where the other members of the threesome were carrying on in the background. After complaints of similar instances from my team I had to take action. I ended up having to call the offending guests and tell them if they could not respect my team by answering the door in at least a closed dressing gown they could come down and collect the rest of their meal from the restaurant. 
Bonus from the same night: had to call an ambulance for a woman with a dislocated shoulder. The guy admitted that they were trying to recreate a bukkake type scene in the shower using conditioner as the 'cum.' He slipped in the conditioner and fell on her.",_lilliput_,11969,2020-02-12 22:47:29

Some of the times, the other person would give a look that pretty much confirmed that they both had very different interpretations of what was going on.

There's an episode of 30 Rock where they mention that ""going to IKEA"" is a big stress test in relationships.  That has nothing on going to a restaurant on the busiest days of the year, particularly Mother's Day, and Valentine's (especially when it's on a weekend).  I'd say 99% of the ""disasters"" I've seen have just been normal run of the mill issues where couples realize they have different levels of patience, and one person undoubtedly gets aggravated with the packed restaurant, and their time is ruined.",teke367,11852,2020-02-12 20:09:39
AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhgc1qh,"I was the manager of a wings-and-pizza place with a full bar - definitely not the kind of place you'd take someone for a ""romantic"" Valentine's Day dinner, but it was still busy because some people aren't very tactful.

We had a guy who had called ahead and asked if we could put a ring in a dessert for him and of course, we obliged. He dropped the ring off the day ahead and I put it in the safe in our office to keep it secure.

Fast forward to Valentine's Day. The couple shows up, and they're so obviously in love that she didn't seem to notice or care about the fact that he had brought her to a middle-of-the road place with a sports-bar atmosphere on the most romantic day of the year. They ordered champagne (well, the local winery's best sparkling white), entrees, and it was almost time for dessert. I had used my Chef skills to whip up a special chocolate strawberry tart that wasn't on the menu, just for this occasion (because why not try to make their night at least a *little* fancy?)

I went to the safe to get the ring, and... ***It wasn't there.*** I was freaking out big time. I asked everyone there if they knew what the fuck had happened to it. My assistant manager on-site had no idea, so I called my other assistant (who also had the safe code) and they didn't know, either. Finally, my bar manager mentioned that one of the owners had been in earlier, and spent a little time in the office. So, at my wit's end, I called the owner.

It turns out that he had seen the ring in the safe, and thought it was something a customer had left behind. Figuring that he had come into an extremely lucky situation, he decided (like the scumbag he was) that he'd take it for himself and save money on a gift for his wife on Valentine's.

So, I asked the server and bar manager to help stall the couple. The server told them that we were going to do something special for their big date, and to hold tight. 

I ran out, hopped in my car, and rushed to get the ring from the owner's house (because he was - as I had mentioned - a scumbag, and didn't want to be bothered with bringing the ring to the restaurant himself). 

The bar manager went over to the table, and did some complicated, table-side cocktail mix that had a bunch of flair bartending tricks and ended with a flaming shot that, once dropped into the rest, made it smoke (I was really disappointed when I heard about all of this because I would have loved to see it instead of breaking a ton of traffic laws on my quest to get the ring).

Finally, I rushed back in after about 15 minutes of being on the brink of a heart attack, placed the ring on the dessert, and had their server take it out. At that point, just about the entire staff was watching the table, and when we saw the look on her face, my heart finally started beating again.

She said ""Yes."" And, I started looking for someone else to work for the very next day.

AskReddit,Waiters what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?,f2wokf,fhfjh3i,"My first day of work on the floor at a country club was the weekend after Valentine’s Day. There was a lot of buzz in the back about this adorable family, where every year the mom brought the son out to a nice dinner at the club and the father brought the daughter to the men’s section for a dinner (which shows how much pull the guy had, since women weren’t allowed in that part of the club). It was their Valentine’s Day tradition. The kids are both ~14 or 15. 

I’d also been filled in on the gossip that the waitress I replaced had left to have a baby. She was really young and there was blanket disapproval from the staff and a lot of the members. 

I’m serving the mom and son in the more upscale dining room, but getting drinks from the bar where the dad and daughter are, so I’m around both groups. 

I’m bringing a bottle of wine to the mom when a woman walks in with a baby in a carrier and starts handing personalized golf balls out to people as a birth announcement sort of thing. She hands one to the mom at the table and one to the son and walks off when the mom knocked her wine glass to the floor and starts whisper-shouting at the son. 

People are congratulating the new mom, and pretending to be friendly, and then each table seems to go perfectly quiet one after another. 

I go to the bar to get a new wine glass and see a man duck over to the dad’s table and say something to him. The man gets up without saying a word, (even to his daughter) and dashes into the men’s locker room, leaving her sitting at the table. 

The whole room goes quiet, but nobody intervenes as the old waitress goes over to the table, hands the girl a golf ball, says a few words I can’t hear then walks out of the club. The girl starts sobbing. 

Eventually, the mom seems to have remembered the daughter, because the brother comes and leads her out, and they all leave together.

Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a ""secluded"" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.

Anyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.

Creepiest thing was finding some headless doves.   I also found sticks arranged in circles and paint on the trees in the same spot.  Not sure if it was part of a ritual or not, but that's what I saw.

Edit: Okay lots of great points that it could have been just wildlife or cats catching the doves.  That's totally possible.  I've seen cats do that before too. To add some more context, the type of doves found were not native to this area.  It's possible they escaped or were released and had a run in with a hungry house cat. And the painted circle of trees and sticks nearby was coincidence.  Who knows--I certainly don't know what really happened so it's all speculation. It's still the weirdest/creepiest thing I've ever found.",righteous_meow,17656,2020-10-13 12:16:11

&#x200B;

I live on a ranch off of a quite dirt road.  Our distant neighbors (nearest house is about 1 mile away as the crow flies) have had issues with people stealing things out of their out-buildings and storage sheds in the area.  It was also late in the year, so it was starting to get dark around 6PM.  So as a result every time I would see headlights go down our road I would watch to make sure they weren't stopping on the property. 

One evening I see a vehicle going very slowly down the road and come to a stop at the end of our driveway (about 120 yards from our front porch).  The vehicle is parked right in front of a 60's pickup I have parked, so I think whoever it is might be looking to steal it, or just looking over the property.  Whatever the case, I decide to put on a black coat and grab my rifle to go investigate.  It's dark out, so I stay out of the headlights of the vehicle so I can get close.  I can tell it is a white van, but I don't see anything else distinguishing about the van.  When I'm about 50 yards away the van backs up and turns into our driveway.  I freeze as the headlights wash across me standing in the middle of my driveway....and I see the reflective Fedex logos on the side of the van.

Needless to say the Fedex driver probably shit his pants as he suddenly sees a dark figure standing in the middle of a field, in the dark, holding a rifle.  Surprisingly after I try to give a friendly wave and smile he continues up the driveway to the house, and I get to explain the situation and we both have a laugh.  

So that's how I got to be the creepy guy in some Fedex delivery driver's story.",ls1c-10,16789,2020-10-13 14:47:03

We would go into the forest very early around 4 am. One morning there was a clouded leopard on the trail we used to enter the forest. It was just crouched there watching us. We shouted, tried to act big, one of the indigenous people we worked with even took out his slingshot and shot rocks at it (he missed on purpose just trying to scare it off). It stayed there for a good 5 minutes watching us before it slowly walked into the thick brush off the cleared trail. When we walked by I shined my light to where it had walked to and could clearly see a pair of reflective eyes only 3 meters away crouched watching us pass. Creepy but  also incredibly cool to see one in person for how critically endangered they are

Edit: since I’ve got quite a few requests for pictures I just posted a picture I took of a baby orangutan named Merkur

Edit: These were WILD orangutans. We tried our best to keep our distance and NEVER tried to touch them. The goal was to observe them while trying not to effect their natural behavior. That being said over my year there I did get charged by one of the big dominant males in the area on three separate occasions which is its own terrifying story to tell another time. He never did touch me but sure scared the hell out of me and made me run 

Edit: 
Since a lot of people are asking. I am American who studied biology in college. How I got this job was a combination of luck and preparation. I worked my butt off in college and had field experience and then we had a guest speaker one day who is a big name in orangutan conservation research talk to us. I had always wanted to go to Borneo and got to speak with her after the talk and discovered that she needed two students to go do research for a year after graduation. She interviewed me and the rest was history. I do want to mention to anyone considering this field that it is HARD WORK. We would wake up at 3:30 am, spent 14-15 hours in a swamp forest following wild orangutans taking data every two minutes. It was hot, humid and TONS of mosquitoes. No communication to the outside world except on our days off where we could take a 15 minute walk to a tree stand where we could sometimes  get one bar of service to send a few whatsapp messages to family. The camp was only 15ish people and we would spend 2-4 months there at a time before going back to the city (palangkaraya) to bring back samples. The location of this research was in Central Kalimantan Borneo. That all being said it was an amazing experience of course, saw animals and insects that just blew my minds and I miss it all the time.

It’s like forced hide and seek. Anyway this one night I saw my friend hide in one building while I ran for the trees. I was hiding under some bushes and heard breathing. Like human breathing. There were no animals around. It creeped me out so bad I ran out of hiding to greet my friend. I felt so uncomfortable for the rest of the night.

Every once in a while, a Skua bird or Antarctic Tern would accidentally end up following one of the small planes (Twin Otter) out to our camp. Once there though, they'd basically be stranded with no way to get back to the coast. I'd get out of my tent some mornings and see a lonely Tern circling overhead, knowing it was a dead bird flying. It was quite creepy. 

Along these lines, when birds (or seals) do die down there, it's so cold and dry, that their bodies don't decay either. They essentially mummify. Outside McMurdo at Scott's Discovery Hut, there is still a perfectly preserved seal carcass from 1912 sitting by the entrance of the hut.

Edit: Dang...this kind of blew up. Been working all day and just getting back on now. The short answers to some of your questions are:

- I think it's that the birds more follow the contrails than the planes themselves but I could be wrong. I just know from the various camp managers and other scientists down there (particularly biologists) that told me once a Tern or Skua gets that far away from the coast, they're basically toast due to lack of food and temps.

- I have some old pics from my 2008-2010 deployments...but only as partial albums in an old flickr account. Knock yourselves out if you really want. Any album with WAIS in the name was from antarctica. https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/albums

- How did I get down there? I was in graduate school studying glaciology, paleoclimatology, and in some sense, geophysics. I deployed as part of a big NSF grant to extract and study an ice core record. I actually went back in 2015 to South Pole to work on that core as well. Last year, I deployed on a research ship off the coast of West Antarctica as part of a ocean sediment core team...which was also quite interesting. You can get down there as a tourist as well (see ALE expeditions), but it'll cost you over 10k.

- The most amazing place I visited was the area around Union Glacier to work on remote seismic and GPS stations. We flew all over to tiny exposed rocks in the middle of nowhere. It was quite surreal. Most of those pics are here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/albums/72157628321851875

- I watched the ""Thing"" at least once a season (as is tradition).

- My little claim-to-fame factoid is that technically I was the first person to reach the south pole in 2016 (I went out to the marker at midnight on dec 31st, 2015). Which also brings up the somewhat eerie notion that while at the south pole, literally every person alive or dead is north of you (except for maybe astronauts on the ISS?)

- While at south pole, I successfully completed the first every 50-mile running ultramarathon in -40C temps...it was insanely stupid...but still kind of fun (see also here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGy_U8AebT8)

Once the light turned off we looked to see what it was. Saw nothing; no trace of an aircraft or anything. 

Couple minutes go by and the same light shined on us, this time it was on the other side of our vessel, above mountains. Still, unable to see what it was. We all saw it, we all have never seen any aircrafts hovering above these waters, especially at 2am.

The one thing that really creeps you out is when a hit is put on someone in the middle of the night. 

Inmate's code says it is kept as quiet as possible. No one says a damn word. The only thing you'll hear are grunts and moans from the victims. Then, it goes and stays silent. If you hear it happening, it's already too late to stop it. It'll be over before you pull your keys out.

Was part of a crew that would spend two weeks camping in remote places to do manual labor in places machines couldn't get to. 

For this story, we were building new hiking/biking trails in the back portion of a designated wilderness area in a high altitude desert. This means that the nearest civilization was a 2 hour car ride to a town of 41 people in a sandy soil area where tracks last forever.

It was the middle of our stint during the early part of the night where everyone else had gone to bed but I stayed up to read, so maybe 11:30 or so. Still pitch black outside, clouds had covered stars. so my head lamp was probably the only light on in a 40 mile radius. 

Suddenly I hear footsteps walking around our camp and head towards the tents from where I was in the community tent. That sound immediately put me on edge as I felt the hair on my arms raise and my adrenaline spike. I recall thinking to myself that two things are very wrong since the person was not using a light to see and the footsteps were not coming towards me from the tents, rather it was the opposite.

Within the four seconds it took me to drop my book, get up, and turn the corner of the tent to cast my light on the sleeping tents, the sound had stopped but I saw tracks in dirt before me. Looked like they came from one end of camp, looked into my tent, walked through the sleeping tents and kept going out of camp again.

I don't know if I was making too much noise or not by walking around, but the rest of my crew ended up waking up and asking me what was going on from inside their tents. After explaining what I found, they all got up to look at the boot prints in the dirt. They were damn near perfect copies of my own boots except for one small thing, I had a rock stuck in my treads that messed up the symmetry. (I was wearing fairly common work boots, except I also happen to wear US size 15 double wide boots, so there was no way in hell this was one of the other crew members)

I don't think any of us slept much that night. Never saw or heard anything more after that night.

Wouldn't say anything was particularly paranormal creepy but it can be very unsettling/weird place. 

Fog can come rolling in out of nowhere and other rigs you can see off the sides can disappear in front of your eyes. Sometimes you can't see the walkways 6ft in front of you or if you're walking over grating you can't see the sea below your feet (about 60m down from feck to sea) but you can hear it, all be it muffled. The fog can roll in over the course of a few minutes too so a perfectly clear day becomes pea soup.

You can also feel the rig moving/swaying on high winds /rough seas. Even though it's a fixed leg Platform. Very unnerving to feel your office swaying when it shouldn't be.

My last trip was my first ever Nightshift and I found it particularly unsettling as you've got the background noise of the plant but I walked around the whole rig without seeing another living soul for the whole shift (usually there are about 130 people on board although smaller rigs have smaller headcounts) . 

Usually once a trip im hit by this awareness that you are just very isolated and in the middle of no where (most rigs I've worked on are an hour's chopper ride from land). So if things go wrong it can escalate very quickly.",sootsprite13,5000,2020-10-13 14:43:44

A local took me way out into the woods one night because he *swore* that at midnight at this one spot you could see the ghostly carriage where some people froze to death.

Obviously expected to see nothing.

So we're sitting there in absolute pitch black darkness. You can't see your hand in front of your face or anything around you. The sky is slightly, slightly grey from the thin cloud cover reflecting distant lights but that's it. You can't even really make out the tree line.

We never do see a carriage. Or anything. 

At about 12:20 or so we're just smoking and chatting, thinking about leaving, when we hear the unmistakable sounds of someone walking through the underbrush. Loud crackling of breaking sticks and branches.

But still, everything is black.

It gets closer and louder, but we don't see anyone coming. There's nothing. And all we can think is how it's basically suicide to trudge through these woods at night. Good way to get a stick in the eye at the very least, and eventually you *will* twist an ankle or break something when you step off a ledge - the ground around here is very uneven.

But it's definitely someone coming. Crack, snap, snap...

In the pitch black? Nope. We drive the hell out if there.

We weren't afraid it was a ghost. We were afraid it was a person insane enough to be marching through the woods without a light. Do not want to meet that guy.

**Update**: for those of you comforting yourself that it was just an animal...

When I say ""up north"" I want you to imagine a place where you literally have to drive 3 hours to arrive at the closest city, and another 3 after that to get to the next one.

And when I say noise I'm not talking squirrels. Think rhythmic, and think large branches snapping on the ground. I'd been up there long enough to know what a possum sounds like.

That big it might have been a bear, but a bear wandering around at night is not normal - which I suppose means it would have been pretty messed up, and that makes it worse. Moose?

The neighbors would let their Basset Hound outside for about 10 minutes to use the bathroom every morning.

One morning they let him out, and he didn’t come back inside. After a couple minutes they walked out to his favorite bathroom spot, and found...his head. Judging from the tracks, a mountain lion had ambushed him and apparently torn his head off before carrying the body away. 

What I thought was the creepiest part was that the family hadn’t heard a sound.

Which was essentially just summer camp during the school year and school groups would come up and spend a few days at the camp. On their last night we would always tell them a scary story around the campfire. It was the same scary story every time. We worked in partners so there were always two staff members for every school group. One staff member would tell the story and the other staff member would go hide in the forest and make scary noises. So, I’m telling the story and every few minutes there’s like a snap of a twig or rustling in the bushes and of course as always the kids all get freaked out and they start getting scared. It’s very fun. Well, as I’m telling a story I’m walking around the campfire looking at all the kids faces and I noticed a familiar one. My partner Eric. Sitting there smiling at me wondering why I’m staring at him. My heart has never started beating so fast in my life. Eventually I sped through the story and all the kids left and I explain to Eric that I thought it was him in the woods and his eyes got very wide and he said are you telling me that that wasn’t one of the staff members?

The damned thing was just watching me there and probably could have ended me without me even realizing it.  I've never seen a cougar in the wild before and its hard to understand just how big they are and how powerful until you see one up close.

AskReddit,"Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work?",jab3wa,g8oxq90,"I used to work as an alligator hunting guide for trophy hunters during my summers, south of New Orleans. Spending sunup to sundown deep in the heart of cajun swamp territory definitely left me seeing some weird and creepy things. 

The first one that comes to mind is when I saw what my hunting partner at the time called the Loup-Garoux. I personally would have called it a chupacabra but that’s because I’m a native of the southwest, not the south. 

We were riding through an area deep in the swamp looking for signs of a big gator. The banks were close on both sides of the boat there was barely enough water for us to push ahead. But those mud boats are impressive and can practically run on dry land so onwards we pressed. 

Suddenly, I saw a grey flash in the trees out of the corner of my eye. It made me nervous. Swamp deer are small and shy. There’s not many mammals that want to hang out in thick undergrowth and knee-deep mud and hidden gators. 

I tapped my partners shoulder to catch his attention over the sound of the motor and pointed in the direction I saw the flash. He cut the motor and asked if it was a gator slide. I shook my head and said I had no idea what it was but I saw something. 

As we were looking around us the creature I saw stepped out from the trees. It was big, on all fours, with mottled grey skin. It’s movements were janky, jerky. It had a canine-like face and it locked eyes with me and I felt sick to my stomach. My partner immediately struck the motor back up and we reversed out of there as quickly as we could. 

My rational brain said “poor creature with mange, either a massive coyote or maybe a wild dog” but my primal monkey brain was screeching “MONSTER! RUN! OR DIE!” 

It was definitely a freaky experience, even knowing what it probably was.",Manic_Pixie_Princess,3122,2020-10-13 13:55:13
AskReddit,"Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work?",jab3wa,g8p4b8m,"During college that was located away from major cities, the woods were all around us. That being said, there was a highly rated trail, the Loyalsock Trail, which was about an hour drive from the university. I invited a friend to come with me as he had never been on an extended backpacking trip. A 50+ mile trail that we intended to backpack over the four day weekend. I am an Eagle Scout who has spent countless hours in the woods and went on backpacking trips consistently throughout my college experience. As many have said before me, you get used to the minor “spooky” things happening; Coyote howls, raccoons in the middle of the night, even the occasional unknown noise. The scariest thing to find in the woods, however, are people.

We were about 20 miles into the trail and, being Pennsylvania where the underbrush and trees line the trails pretty densely, I always walk about 100 meters off of the trail to reduce the chances of me disturbing people/people disturbing me (especially in the early morning when I choose to sleep in). Following that same strategy, my friend and I go out of our way to be in this amazing spot a good ways off of the trail where it would even be difficult to see our flashlights from the trail. This spot was on a peninsula where a creek met a river, meaning there was only one way into our camp and only one way out. We start a fire, cook our food, and drink some (but not enough to get either of us drunk). We put the fire out about midnight and head in to our individual tents. All is quite. It is the fall semester, so leaves are on the ground, the moon is brightly shining through the bare trees, and the air is cool. The only noise is the occasional time when I would hear my friend turn over in his sleep. Then, I hear the voices...

The voices sounded very close for being on the trail 100+ meters away. I check my watch; 3am. Who hikes at 3am? We are 20 miles in. I slowly get out of my sleeping bag, slowly unzip my tent, only to see my friend peaking out of his tent in the exact same fashion. He quickly moves his finger over his mouth in an exaggerated “hush” signal, then used the same hand to frantically motion towards the way of the trail. Then we see them. Four adults, three men and one woman, walking directly towards our camp. No lights illuminating their path; They are walking silently at this point. Only one of them has a backpack; An impossibility for the long hike they were 1/3 of the way through. Being a long trip, you bring wood cutting supplies to chop branches into smaller branches to burn; For me, this was a survival knife. Grabbing the knife, believing it is my only way of defending myself, I am more disheveled than I ever have been, especially knowing that a knife is barely defense at all. These people walk into our site, sit down by our extinguished fire pit, and just sit there for what felt like an eternity. 

My friend speaks up and asks what they are doing in our campsite. Without answering the question, they ask if we have any food. Having packed as lightly as possible for the long trip. We had only a few extra Mountain House, MRE-style meals. I grab one out of my bag and toss it to one of the men. In rapid succession, I ask why they aren’t using a light, if they need help finding the trail, and why they are hiking so late. They respond with the following:

1) “We don’t use lights”
2) “We know where the trail is”
3) “It is better to hike late at night”

Unnerved at this point, my friend asks them to leave. They respond by asking if we want to light the fire and hangout for a bit. No we do not. They grab their bag, get up, and leave without speaking another word. We watch them leave and take shifts making sure that they didn’t come back. Needless to say, we both got very little sleep that night. When the sun rose the next morning, we finally got “real” sleep. By the afternoon, when we woke up, it all felt like a weird dream of sorts. The only evidence was a fuzzy cap that they must have dropped that I have to this day.

I have never had something as weird/spooky as that happen in the woods and hope to never have it happen again. In the eight years since that trip, I haven’t been back to the Loyalsock Trail.",OandGTechy,3102,2020-10-13 14:57:00

1. Meth labs. Often tucked away in absentee landowner property. Usually some POS RV. 

2. Meth houses. Homes that were clearly abandoned >40 years ago but clearly occupied within the last 5, if not currently. I got curious a few times and poked around inside, but didn’t push too much because they would have heard me in the brush long before I got inside the house. I’d see drug stuff, porn, junk food, mattresses drug in on the floor. Think of the row houses in Hamsterdam in the Wire. 

3. Two of my colleagues have found dead bodies. They were all illegal immigrants crossing north into the US. Most accidents, one was a gunshot. I’ve been in areas with unsolved murders, I just tread lightly with the locals (think of the Ozark tv show).

4. More sad than creepy, but abandoned graveyards. Dozens of them. Locals try to keep up but there is a natural progression of decline and neglect until they’re outright forgotten. It’s sad to see a bunch of graves of kids from ~1900 that all died within a few weeks of each other. More anti-vaxxers ought to see those.

5. I got shot at once.

6. I stumbled into a herd of feral hogs, at night, in really tall cattails. That was more frightening than the snakes, alligators, etc. I couldn’t see them but they were freaking out that I was there. 

7. I’ve seen a few “shrines” of pagans or whatever, but they’re pretty harmless and don’t leave any permanent damage to anything. No harm no foul.

8. A guy in the front yard of his trailer house, deep in the woods in a swamp, shitting in a 5 gallon bucket. Very awkward eye contact.

In middle school, I worked at the school during the summer, doing general painting and helping the maintenance guys. We had to drive out to the fuckoff middle of a Floridian forest to pick up some pine lumber for the gym's new bleachers, and when we got to the mill at like 7am, the whole place was locked down with police. They had found gasoline cans and pill bottles out in one of the tree farm groves, telltale signs of kids abusing substances, but supposedly the cops were there because they found human remains. I was pretty young and I don't remember anything outside of my little kid point of view, but I remember seeing streaks of dark blood running up the trunks of several pines. I've since learned from the guys I was with then that a teenager was killed by a bear after attacking it, and the blood was either from the wounded bear climbing the tree or dragging a hurt person up with it, but I'm sure many of you can agree with me that bears don't do that. And I can't see an injured bear makin it up several pines in a row while bleeding that much.

The answer is, we all want better interpersonal relationships, since seeking the approval we miss/missed through past/current social environments in life. It doesn't matter if its within the household, or within the workplace. Often when it comes to specific porn presenting someone that holds a taboo role, you want to be validated by that someone, you want to strengthen the relationship you feel could be stronger. You also desire to be shown unconditional love and support by the person you're fantasising about, but even so, it's all about  those who were caregivers to you in the past (mum) (dad) (unsexy, yep I know) and not because they are amazingly hot. Instead, it's because you feel like  a worthless peice of shit who doesn't deserve atleast one interaction with that person which validates you as a unique human being.  instead, you fear it's at personal cost to yourself, IRL, that's why it suppresses. This may  not be secure if you otherwise deterred them as the worthless peice of shit you know yourself to be. Nobody likes it if you challenge them/balance challenges and roles of the people who prevent you from having personal  expectations and Bounderies. You prefer your mind where for a moment you hold the power and love.

Hentia is same deal diff colour of people. 

You're suppressed and trying to use porn as a psychological tool to rienforce why you felt your childhood was dirty, and why it means you are too. it's a psychological form of self harm for those who grew up with cartoons being part of their childhood routine on a much more frequent basis. You also like to imagine yourself as a harsh and cruel individual but Hentia helps you find ethical reason and solution. N you want to be loved. 

Self awerness around why we do the weird shit we do.

It will help you realize we are never really THIS person or THAT person, but rather in the words of Sartre; we are always in the process of becoming.


This helps do away with the bad faith in ""finding myself"", which so many of us feel we need to do, when in reality we always are in that process.

We all have maps of our time in school, how people treat us, all of our experiences. We also make maps about other people, we make assumptions about others based on what we see or hear. We get maps from others about us too, especially friends and parents. What they tell us we are, what we think they see when they look at us, what we think they think about us, etc etc etc.

People tend to focus on maps, and label themselves, pigeonhole themselves into roles and what they think they should do, feel, or be based on the maps that they have.

You are not a map. You are a 3D terrain of whatever beautiful biome you want to be. Don't stare at a map all day and forget too look up at what it really is.

There were these high ideals that I always maintained and couldn't live up to them. Mostly because they were about saving the world and unattainable things like that. I spent an absurd amount of my teenage years studying philosophy and religion rather than dealing with teenage social issues like my peers. Ever since I was a kid, I had this goofy side though. When I wasn't pulling my hair out reading about semiotics, I would write silly stories to make people laugh.

When I went to college, things changed. I began exhibiting some really dangerous behavior patterns, especially for someone with a huge conscience like myself. The line between my public and private life got larger. I began feeling I could no wrong. I don't really want to list some of the things I did here because of shame. But suffice it to say, you would have all hated college me.

I'm going to skip to the end and just say this all got worse until I woke up one day and all my lightheartedness was gone. I was working a high paying meaningless job. I'd cheated on everyone I dated and thrown away every romantic relationship, some very painfully.

My life had become all about money, sex, and status.

The biggest epiphany of my life was realizing two things.

One, everyone goes through some form of this. We all try on different faces. If we find one that doesn't fit, we still tend to cling to it so that we don't have to change our current comfort level. This phase is normal and human.


Two, I was bipolar. Manic. My post puberty life was punctuated by periods of unbelievable energy and increasingly risky behavior. It put me on top - there were years where I had fans. I got up on stage and gave speeches and made people laugh and was the center of attention. And later it landed me in jail because the center cannot hold.

But with that diagnosis I finally was able to figure out my history and why I could never live up to those ideals. Because grandiosity is a textbook manic symptom too.

These days I don't push myself to do any more than love my family and enjoy the little things. I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime. I deserve a rest, at least for a little while.

Sorry this is so long.


The answer is that the normal cycle is to lose yourself for a little while and then find yourself again. Everyone has an existential crisis to some degree. You have to trust that this is normal and your real self is always there waiting for your return.

How you return, that will be unique. A death in the family, jail, overdose, failed relationship, financial loss, you name it. Something has to touch you deeply and it will happen. In the natural course of things we all take a big hit sooner or later.


I don't like to generalize but the 20s are a time when people tend to drift away from themselves. After that it's really anyone's guess when you'll come back.

But since you're asking this question, I say it will be sooner than later for you.",LonelyPauper,1166,2019-07-25 11:36:25

 Within my friend group I started gradually lowering my filter and saying more of what I thought, gauging reactions and then instead of changing my filter, I shifted who I would spend more time with.

It really sounds trivial, and it is, but all you can really do is try to be yourself even if you don't know who that is.

”We seldom realize, for example, that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by society... Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body. Yet the very society from which the individual is inseparable is using its whole irresistible force to persuade the individual that he is indeed separate!

I cope with what I have been given, floating around in a seemingly empty shell. As for the reality part, I have no idea what is real or not. This all feels so simulated. Life feels like nothing but a sandbox simulation to me. No matter how many nights I wake up screaming and gasping for air, no matter how much pain I feel, no matter how happy and in love I may be, it all feels like a sick and melancholic game. I am not real to myself anymore. My life is no longer real.

It was like I wasn't really just one person, but just a bunch of different versions of me. It's something I still struggle with, but spending more time alone has helped a lot. Also I don't see myself moving again any time soon since I'm in college, so I'm taking advantage of this time to really figure out my character. 

I didn't even realize how little I knew who I was until a friend asked about what my life was like before college, and I couldn't come up with just one answer. Instead of being my full self wherever I went, I adapted to the culture I was immersed in, and then got ready to change again once we moved to the next place. It was hard as a kid, but I was always pretty happy no matter where I was, and now I have time to settle down a little bit.",no_thisispatrick21,52,2019-07-25 12:08:34

Imagine that you were born to a different set of parents, in a different location, family, and had different life experiences. What parts of you would still be the same? This is your ""core self"". We all have a core but have to put on layers as we get older and go through life's challenges.

If so, how did you overcome this?",chm4um,euv8uat,"Lots and lots of self reflection. Ask yourself why you do *everything.* Look at your friends and ask yourself why you spend time with them. If you only get this feeling at work/school, maybe it’s time to look for new work or focus on different studies. Maybe even change your major. 

If you still can’t figure it out, look into the benefits of LSD/acid and see if you feel comfortable taking some. A moderate dose for a newbie can cause something called ego death. Basically for 6-12 hours you lose your sense of “self” and act without consulting your personality. Unless you have any preexisting mental conditions, acid is relatively safe as long as you trip in a safe environment.

I’m not telling you acid will solve your problems, but maybe once a year I do a relatively large dose of acid alone and focus on myself. This has helped me quit smoking, pull myself out of deep depressions for months at a time, and generally gives you a fresh outlook on how your life is going.",None,49,2019-07-25 12:19:33

I can say I'm a brave person. I can also say I'm cowardly. They're opposites and yet I'm both, depending on my situation and how I'm feeling in the moment. People aren't static, they're dynamic. We are all who we are in the moment. Who we are in the moment depends on a variety of different factors. But I am not who I have been, and I'm not who I will be. I am me. And the only me that matters and the only one I truly am is right now. Am I irritable and short tempered right now? Then that's who I am. Am I determined, motivated, and disciplined right now? Then I'm that person. Who I was yesterday isnt who I am today. And I wont be the same tomorrow, or even an hour from now. You are right now. Embracing it in this way gives me the ability to change who I am in the moment. ""I'm a coward right now. But I dont want to be a coward, I want to be brave,"" and you realize you can be. Because past you doesnt matter, present you does. If present you wants to be different, then be different. Chances are, you'll want to be a different person in the future, and that's okay. Humans are made to adapt.

Look at things like horoscopes or zodiac signs. The descriptions are so vague that the people who believe in them partly buy into it because, chances are, they exert those qualities at least some of the time. Your zodiac sign says you're stubborn, courageous, and warm-hearted? You've probably been all of those things at some point. You most likely will never be those things all of the time.

The issue is I get stuck in a never ending chain chasing something that doesn't exist.

My advice is to just be. Think of yourself on a boat, sailing the seas and letting the waves take you wherever the current flows.

I'd also suggest meditating on the Buddhist idea of 'Anatta' which translates as 'no self.' You are in constant change and have no permanent essence or being. If you cling to the idea that you do have a permanent self, this is when you experience 'tanha' (craving), which then leads to suffering. It's a bit of a hard concept to get your head around, but I've found that just bearing this in mind helps me accept who I am. And hopefully it will for you too!",isotie,18,2019-07-25 13:58:26

If so, how did you overcome this?",chm4um,euvqjtq,"Yes, regularly. This is my experience, how I view it:

At your core, you are always the ""real you"". Sometimes the ""real you"" may go ignored, because of protective ways you have learned to cope with the world. 

After all, listening to and being the ""real you"" is exposing the core of yourself to the world - the good, the bad and the ugly. Sometimes we have got so used to protection our true selves, our true self doesn't get a look in.

This can also create a disconnect. Because we are hiding the ""real us"", we grow discontent with ourselves. We know that we are not being authentic. We try to envision what we wish we could be, and because we are discontent, we may instead imagine an ""ideal self"". We view this ""ideal self"" as what we would be, if we just tried hard enough - if we didn't let petty things get in the way of being ""true to ourselves"" - but in reality, we are not the ""ideal self"".

And it's often the straining to reach the idea of some kind of ""ideal self"" that prevents the ""real you"" from being appreciated, listened to, validated, honored. 

We berate ourselves for not reaching that ideal. We dislike the ""real self"" because the ""real self"" is not the perfect ideal.

To reach the real me, I have to let go of the ideal me.",crysanthemumCord,8,2019-07-25 14:18:53

The best advice is to literally submit and stop trying to fight yourself and how you think of yourself. Youve got yourself into this shit, so if you knew any better it would have happened already. Just submit, then accept that only you can make a choice to change. 

Then you make a choice to seek help, from someone outside of yourself to confide in. Unburden your trapped mindset and let it out and be brave and honest. This needs to be someone you trust.

Then finally, make a decision. Now that you've surrendered and accepted yourself for where you've gotten yourself, and you've unburdened your mind of self deprecating thoughts, make a choice to learn new patterns and habits. Start small and grow them into who you wish to become.

Understand that these are monuments you've built in your head for your habits and who you think you are in your head. You need to take the time to unlearn so you can grow.",Werealldudesyea,9,2019-07-25 15:05:34
