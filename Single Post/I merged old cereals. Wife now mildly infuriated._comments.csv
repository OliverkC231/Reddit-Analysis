It was already half was done, my dad comes over earlier in the day and decides it's okay to fill the bottle up with water. I come back thinking maybe it's a new half gallon. I drink some and the juice was completely watered down. I got so pissed and he told me he was trying to help save money. I understand his reasoning behind it, but this isn't a way to save money. If it were to be half a glass and a little water to top it off, maybe, but not for a half gallon. Same went with my chicken wings. I was saving them and he threw them out the next day when I came back from school because they ""expired"" the next day. And they were no where near bad.
