Their last film they were working on that got cancelled by Disney after the buyout (that only had one year left of production btw) was an animated version of the Nimona graphic novels.

Many suspect that Disney decided not to finish it because it will be a landmark film for LGBTQ+ representation in animated films. Disney does not have a great track record with putting openly gay characters in their films, and this movie supposedly was not hiding anything (and they shouldn’t!).

Good news is Netflix bought it and are completing it. Some of the old crew were hired to complete it in addition to new crew members. It will be completed by the studio DNEG who also just recently made Rons Gone Wrong. 

So if you want to continue to support this legendary studio, even postmortem, I would check it out, it should come out next year.",npapeye,1,2022-04-14 03:04:33

He should have swirled it in the air, dangled it like a grape, sniffed it and then shoved the whole thing in his mouth and smiled a big smile before popping out the top, then checked it for more, flipping it back and forth in his hands, realizing his tasty treat was gone.  Then, wilting, licked out the edges of the acorn hat, sniffed it, put it right side down, then upside down and tried to nudge it, as if it could still go flying somewhere.  Then, after snuggling with it for a second, seeing it won't roll off without him, his tummy wiggles and he realizes he might be getting hungry again.  He sits for a moment, playing with it like a top, but it settles, quietly.  He sits, staring pensively at it for a moment, begins to walk away, then looks back, as if he might catch it moving out of the corner of his eye, but it doesn't move, and his tummy grumbles again, driving him onward.

he finally got his acorn 🥺,u33nuc,i4q82wf,"Blue Sky Studios ended over COVID-19. That was it. They weren't planning on this. When Disney bought Ice Age, they basically fired all of the GOOD original animators, and replaced them with a handful of ameuters. Even the original voice actors were fired, except Buck's for the cash-grabbing sake of it all. They reduced the quality of the animation to a real shit storm just so they could grab a few hundred thousand from naive kids who wouldn't really pick up on why the cast sounds so different. Manny's actor was probably the best sounding one; even Buck seemed off kilter.

After growing up with this franchise, which came out when I was 2, it's safe to say that Buck Wild was definitely NOT my cup of tea or worth watching. I somehow managed to sit through it because I used to love Crash and Eddie. That movie installment even disintegrated their likability. For some reason, Scrat wasn't even in it — or the supporting characters: Granny, Louis, Peaches, Shira, or the baby. 

If only.. if only I could've submitted the better fanfiction that I wrote when I was 12. Fucking 12!! Buck Wild was thrown together so much, that it seemed like a 5 year old wrote it.

Blue Sky’s use of the character was never legitimate and a lawsuit against them (and their acquirer, Disney) prevents them from using the character in any future films without paying royalties to the original artist.

So, instead of paying the royalties to the artist who conceived of Scrat, Disney decided to just pull the character entirely. Yay corporate!

Blue Sky Studios was a subsidiary of 20th Century Animation until its acquisition by Disney, as part of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets in 2019. In February 2021, Disney announced that Blue Sky would be shut down in April 2021 citing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations. The studio ceased all operations on April 10, 2021.

Ice Age and Rio were the studio's most commercially successful franchises, while Robots, Horton Hears a Who!, The Peanuts Movie, and Spies in Disguise were among its most critically praised films. Scrat, a character from Ice Age, was the studio's mascot.",life-is-a-lemon,1,2022-04-14 12:00:10

Two of my friends in very different industries have had their companies bought by a massive multinational recently and for no other discernable reason than to eliminate competition. One of them folded the original company's brand near-immediately and aren't doing anything to replace the employees of that old company leaving in droves. Eventually those employees may build up another business to compete and the cycle will start again, but they will have to struggle much more for market share than the identifiable brand did.

What is happening is that as the atmosphere heats up, the deserts are spreading further north and south of the equator.

FWIW Blue Sky was fighting for ownership of the character from an artist that claimed to have introduced it to the studio before the first film. And upon buying the studio, Disney actually just kinda conceded the fight and the artist won right back a few months ago, so while sad for Blue Sky to go, this was sorta inevitable it sounds like, I have no idea how Disney is releasing a show based on the character now though, hopefully the original artist owner get a paid..

Animated television is the big exception unfortunately, since it usually requires more budget than indie groups can typically field.

On the plus side, crowdfunding and indie access to software/tools/etc really has helped to expand many of these, if slowly, and they can still influence corporate-owned development (e.g. I can't imagine something like Centaurworld getting greenlit 10 years ago).",noratat,19,2022-04-14 01:23:49

Their old pipeline was simply inefficient and ineffective, and (if I remember the story correctly, it's been a few years) when they attempted a test to see if they could adopt the entirely new software to produce something of equal quality within a month they were able to produce something of greater quality within a week using the new software and pipeline.",ButtersTheNinja,2,2022-04-14 23:08:45

Like a car company buying another, but letting them do what they want so long as they use the provided frames and engines.

This move is part of a broader Disney strategy to wipe out all competitors and fold them into a single entity. Even Pixar, while still holding some autonomy, has gradually lost its own brand and been forced to fall in line to Disney executive desires. It's only a matter of time until they too are deemed unnecessary and gutted.

If I recall correctly you might be thinking of the look of picture test for Nimona, which used a lot of the new software but the pipe was _far_ from complete. [This still from the recent Nimona announcement actually came from that sequence test, back in 2018.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nimona.jpeg) They had it on loop in an office theater once it was done and I watched it maybe a thousand times. 

Hank Driskill was CTO and has landed at Cinesite now, I'm somewhere else but we're still in contact :)

The Scrat Shorts that just came out were the only finished work with the new pipeline. Nimona would've been the first movie on it. It was a necessary change and it pissed off a lot of the old guard. He also moved in from Disney Animation and displaced a cofounder as CTO, which didn't help ingratiate him. That old renderer was ahead of the curve in the 2000s-- check out how _Robots_ looks compared to other CG at the time-- but that window had long passed.",grim_glim,1,2022-04-14 23:32:49

Still I'd say as a studio they were pretty mediocre overall but Ice Age, Shrek, and Toy Story are some very nostalgic animated franchises for me and with Dreamworks and Pixar still pumping out great movies like they were 20 years ago it's a shame to see one of their former competitors collapse like this.",RealisticTax2871,1,2022-04-14 05:18:43

Right up until the Pixar acquisition, Pixar had a run of about ten hugely popular and well reviewed movies, while Disney had a string of about ten absolute duds.  

It’s actually quite interesting to plot the box office revenues from 1995-2005 of all the major Disney releases vs all the major Pixar releases and it’s literally the Disney line going down fast and the Pixar line going up fast at the exact same time.

Not only did Disney keep the Pixar management in place, they let people like John Lassiter help turn around the Disney animation studios.  After Lassiter arrive, Disney finally had some huge hits like Tangled and Frozen.

Not only would it have been a very bad situation idea for Disney to not learn from the Pixar touch, everyone at Disney was still basically doing the traditional 2D hand drawn method, and it was clear they needed to move towards a more 3D computer rendered style, but the only way that would happen is if Pixar starting telling Disney what to do and not vice versa.

Probably the smartest thing Disney did in the last 20 years was buying Pixar, and the second smartest thing they did was ask Pixar to help them turn things around.

I don't agree completely to this, but I get his point.

I actually think that the company actually managed to avoid feeling repetitive by reinventing its characters with the What if mini series, making a virtually endless source of stories with familiar figures. 

We could also consider reboots and/or adequating the stories to our times every X years, making the franchise feel new, that's kind of the strategy of every occidental studio, because it profits more without the effort of creating new histories *and* new characters, BUT that's not inherently bad.

Another thing I remembered is their handling of legacy games. They have so many beloved series and games which they will just let sit and die, and bankrupt anyone who tries to preserve them or make them available for current generations.

Either that or charge a full modern day game price for a 20 year old game that they didn't even update graphics or game play on.

How are they any different outside of being more quiet about it? They massively upped the amount being donated to anti-gay politicians in Florida after their new CEO was installed.

Also, interesting enough, [they nixed the gay kiss scene from Lightyear](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/pixar-lightyear-same-sex-kiss-1235209179/) and it was only brought back after massive backlash of their support of the Don't Say Gay bill as a concession to combat backlash from the pro-gay community and [this joint statement from Pixar employees](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/disney-pixar-same-sex-affection-censorship-dont-say-gay-bill-1235200582/) confirming that they do, in fact, demand cuts to almost every instance of overt gay affection in their media. Of course they're not going to shutter Pixar over it, but Blue Sky had already been scrapped for parts and was pre-production on a new IP, completely expendable. And also, it makes no sense to go to the expense start pre-production on a new IP and then shut them down shortly later, literally weeks after storyboarding of a gay kiss arose, well after the effects of COVID were known. Especially a Disney+ property wherein not only did COVID not negatively affect the service, but actually lent viewership to it because lockdowns shut down competing entertainment options. Not surprisingly, but kind of ironically, the IP was picked up by Netflix who is always salivating to show overt gay affection.

Now, if they had shut it down in 2020, okay maybe they were overspeculating. But to cite the fiscal issues of Covid a year after lockdowns began, for their platform which doubled in size in the previous year throughout Covid, is a really transparent and lazy as an excuse.

Again, Disney at the time of this was completely middle of the road, wanting to appear pro-gay to draw in that audience, but also not willing to actual feature gay affection to avoid driving away the other audience.

Instead of vilifying them as authoritarian extremists, why don't you ask them what their values actually are? Perhaps what kinds of social services they believe should be standard? Or what they think of unregulated/minimally regulated markets? 

Communism isn't intrinsically authoritarian. Authoritarianism has just historically been used to attempt to quickly transform countries' economies — to very limited success, since modern Russia and China are a far cry from ""communism"". The only thing that really seems to have stuck from those regimes seems to be authoritarian governmental structures that they founded.

Communist ideologies offer many valid criticisms about capitalism, and different people are gonna have different ideas of what principles they think might work or could be adapted to modern society to aid in the various oppressive aspects of capitalism.

Also they look nothing alike other than the fact that they’re both squirrels with large front teeth and that they have similar names. 

On the other hand, the squirrel’s entire philosophy and vitae is never giving up, and a fictional character isn’t purely a visual creation, but one with purpose that the creator imbues into it. 

Kind of like how you need rights to produce a movie based on a book. The movie will not be a 1 to 1 reproduction, and the characters might look similar to their descriptions in the corpus in which they were manifested, but they’re not 1 to 1 copies. This kind of creator - producer relationship is already the precedent, and the studio should have been more diligent in securing the rights to anything that was created externally. 

The creator may have been opportunistic, but I can’t really blame her for realizing her legal rights. To blame the studio’s closing on this alone sounds like a reach to me, though now that she has the rights to a character with a very specific and worn out purpose, I don’t see why she didn’t just sell it to the studio. Maybe it has something to do with royalties? Does she plan to license the character to studios?

In a show of good faith I'll reply to one of the less repetitive things you've said:

> You can’t just use an imaginative form of rule that hasn’t been tested like capitalism and say omg it’s so much better, everybody will have it better under my rule! Because you don’t know that, and when we did try a form of your rule, it got fucked very very quickly.

For one you've contradicted yourself, you're calling it an imaginative form of rule, but you're also saying that in the cases it has been tested, it gets fucked.

I've been telling you, *those two specific examples* you keep harping on about were fucked specifically because they were authoritarian shitholes. Dictators suck across the board.

As for calling communism an imaginative form of rule that hasn't been tested, that's just a superficial way of shutting down any constructive discussion on the topic.

The whole reason I initially replied to you was to ask the person *you originally replied to* about their personal ideas on the subject, instead of assuming they're a tankie. **You still haven't replied to this and yet are adamant that I'm the one not paying attention.**

You don't know what my thoughts on the matter are, yet you're trying to strawman me into the arguments *you* want to discuss. All I was saying was who the fuck knows what the opinions of the person you initially replied to are, so why not ask *them*? 

For better or worse, people tend to use ""communism"" pretty loosely (even just for leftist ideas that loosely stem from communist ideologies) so why jump to your own conclusions before they've even had a chance to explain themselves?",MiniDickDude,1,2022-04-15 03:47:50
