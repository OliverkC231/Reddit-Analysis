I used to sit there and listen to the BS about the company and the work, knowing it was all nonsense from our on-the-ground perspective...getting more and more frustrated with the job, my manager, and the company.

As soon as I started challenging stuff in the company Workplace social media and meetings, and becoming more militant in my stance, I found I am much more confident in challenging important things like health and safety or orders from supervisors to do things against the policy that could result in firing.  Whereas before I would have just done stuff and then stewed about it, becoming jaded and miserable and angry.

I am more at peace with my manager, as talking to him has demonstrated to me he is under pressure to get us to believe those things he is told by the C suite and so on, so he is as much a 'victim of BS' as us,  and colleagues because they have said they feel the same and have thanked me for speaking out.

I used to be a huge ass hole. I was ""tough"" for the sake of being tough. I was ""right"" for the sake of being right. I interrupted people when they spoke. My favorite topic was me. I ""jokingly"" teased people. I was in a hugely toxic relationship where we were both terrible to each other. I was angry all the time, I was always the victim, and on my 32nd birthday, I found myself celebrating alone and without friends. 
  
I sat there for a long time and tried to pick apart what had happened. My first deduction was it's them, not me. Then I realized I was the common denominator in this equation. 
  
That's when I changed pretty much everything. I stopped watching a certain hate-filled news channel. I started to try putting in effort to be kind to people. It was hard to relearn how to argue, disagree, or even converse, but I stuck with it, using online advice forums to learn how. I identified my own toxic behavior and learned about it, trying to pull the weed from the root so it never grew back. 
  
The biggest, neat change I made was hanging out with a whole shit load of people who I didn't really agree with their views on the world. I listened to feminists, drug addicts, liberals, POC, people who had lost it all, musicians who hated the government and people who chant ""acab.""

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpy6f03,"I was raised to be very conservative, but I've since deconstructed by using a specific mindset that I am confused to see a lot of people don't. Basically, whenever I see people that I don't understand at first (race, religion, LGBTQ+, poly, etc), I ask myself two simple questions:
1. Are they hurting me directly?
2. If not, are they hurting anyone I care about directly?

If the answer to both of those questions is ""No"", then why the hell would I care? In the time it takes to sit and stew in my anger and hatred, I can just as easily talk to/read up on the people I don't understand, and come to understand them over time. Following this process has made my life so simple and well rounded. I've made cherished friends and experienced such delights as others could only dream of.

I can't understand why you would fear trans women in the women's bathroom, but I've seen my best friend light up when her genderfluid spouse enters the room. I will never accept hating someone by the color of their skin, and because of that, I've enjoyed visiting other countries and working with people with very different skillsets from myself because the fact that they celebrate Denali or Ramadan doesn't affect me in any way other than to pique my curiosity in these holidays as another occasion to cherish loved ones.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpx6r21,"Don't challenge Murphy's Law. 


Couple weeks ago the dispatcher of my temp agency showed me how to fill out the timesheet for a new (to me) client, what info goes where, the shebang. 


When she started to put in the actual shift times I said, Stop! Don't jinx it. Something may go wrong (public transport), I may run late, and I'll have to rewrite this timesheet. And I may show up late to my new client. So, don't do it. 


She didn't and everything went fine.  


She gave me a talk about superstition though, nothing serious, we had a good laugh about it.


Fast forward to this week. New client, new timesheet. She put in the times and I let it slip. And guess what.


I messed up the public transport schedule DESPITE PRIOR PREPARATION and was 30 mins late on my first day on the new job.


Apologized (no big deal) and had to rewrite the timeslip (minor inconvenience).


First Law of Murphy says: 


""Whatever can possibly go wrong WILL go wrong"". And you better listen to Murphy.


Second Law Of Murphy says: 


""Whatever there is that cannot possibly go wrong, guess what, it WILL go wrong too.""


It's basically a lesson about complacency. Shit can happen anytime, and it happens when you're off guard. 


Heed the law of Murphy, and don't jinx yourself. ",CropCircle77,3,2025-04-30 22:32:13

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpy6wxe,"Work left to right. It makes sense if you are right handed, the left hand feeds the work, the right hand does the action and moves the finished item to the right. 

It also works if you are ambi like me, just because there is a method. Most any method is better than no method. If you are a lefty you can work from right to left, but expect compromise if you live with a righty. 

This consistent circle of movement lets you, or anyone else entering your workspace, know where to move things, where to stand to be out of the way and provides lots of other information about what process is going on.

If you walk around the room clock wise, you can move things into the next work area as you go, even if you are just traveling across the room your hands can be carrying objects to the next place they need to be.

You can purposefully set up a workspace to function like this. 

Take the kitchen. 

Viewed from overhead: Groceries come into the kitchen on the north west corner, the dry goods drop underneath the counter, the perishables go in the fridge.

The food from the fridge and dry storage visits the sink in the north. Once cleaned they head to the cutting board in the north east. From there they move to the stove to cook, which is the far east part of the kitchen. Cooked food goes into containers, platters, or plates on the south east side of the kitchen, and eventually winds up on plates on the central to south west corner, where we eat. Leftovers go back into the fridge and we have completed the circle by going from southwest to the northwest fridge.",cheesepage,3,2025-05-01 01:58:56

Sure you can say “ooo that looks nice”

I have lots of trauma around food and diet from the language that was used when I was growing up.

I don’t comment on how much he’s eaten etc. 

We have conversations before and after meals about nutrition and making sure our body is getting what we need. We have conversations about what happens and how our body feels if we eat too much sugar etc. 

But he has learned to trust his gut and trust us.

He doesn’t hide food or pig out at parties. Even at Easter time he doesn’t gorge. Because it’s not taboo. 

Also with others, we don’t yuk somebodies yum. 

The amount of times I didn’t try some food because my mother would say something like “oh yuck that looks disgusting” only to realise years later that I actually really enjoyed whatever it was is wild. I missed out on so much yummy food.

\-I massage my entire body while soaping up in the shower, palpate my lymph nodes, then stretch my entire body before I dry off. I've gotten the whole procedure down to under 30 minutes.

\-I try to act in every situation as best as I can, so that I can be proud of how I act. I consider thoughts action as well.

\-I want to live without regret, so I ask myself if I will regret not doing or doing something, and act accordingly.

\-If I am irritated, I have something to figure out. irritation is a self check emotion for me. It means I do not understand something, or had an ego reaction, or have to learn something...anger comes from several basal fears. fear of the unknown, fear of loss of control, fear of bodily harm / self preservation..etc so I gotta solve whatever fear is causing my irritation, work though it so I donot have that same reaction anymore... works fucking wonders for self improvement.

An example in each direction:

If someone comes up to me and tells me “The problem in this country is that all these illegals are pouring into it! And the Democrats let them right in!” then f—- that person, and I have every right to say something harsh to them in return. They are a bigot. And bigotry is bad.

On the other hand, if someone comes up to me and tells me, “This nation needs God to save itself”, then I should withhold judgment until I *know* that they mean that in the Republican sense. I have known a few liberal Democrats in life who would say that kind of stuff too. They were religious people but also Democrats. And they meant it in a different way (like how Jesus would obviously not be a Republican if he were alive today).

90% of the people who would say that stuff are probably Republicans, but for the sake of the other 10%, I feel that I would not be justified in assuming that someone who says it must be a Republican.",Aaeghilmottttw,2,2025-05-01 02:29:44

If i have food AND a drink however, the food is handled by the left hand(or again both in case of two hand food) and the drink is handled by the right hand, this is very important because if a spill does happen the way i seat myself at restaurants makes sure it doesn't get on the floor, as i sit on the outside of the table with my left side facing nobody else(to avoid accidently elbowing someone). If im eating in a CAR, however, now both food and drink are handled by the left hand, and two hand foods are NEVER to be eaten by me whilst in a car. Does it make sense? No. No, it doesn't.

It's about being able to decipher occurrences and meanings for you, so you can use them as cues to act on something, creative inspiration, a deeper meaning or awareness of something you are going through, unresolved past issues or recurring nightmares, disturbed sleep or a physiological occurrence during the night which signals you should be aware of taking better care of yourself.

It's about getting in tune with yourself and being able to tell the difference between the random vs the intended and when you start taking notice you will get used to your own natural patterns and the dreams your mind gives you for different scenarios.",aurora_ethereallight,2,2025-05-01 10:39:30

Depression, Anxiety, and addiction run through my family tree. It was made pretty clear to me that I was high risk before I went to uni. Even if I have alcohol in my home, I never drink unless someone is over (and also drinking). And due to being an introvert and needing time alone, this means I'll never drink more than two days in a row cause I get peopled out and need recovery time. 

I strongly believe this helped me through the pandemic. I saw both family and friends develop unhealthy habits and addiction, but my rule kept me from drowning in the bottle.

Reasoning: I grew up with tons of alcoholics, so when I finally grew to drinking age and wanted to try it, these were the rules I put in place for myself so I wouldn’t become an alcoholic myself.

It means, for consumables, keep poor quality emergency backups. When you run out of something, it's better to have something than nothing. But having something of poor quality still incentivizes you to actually go out and get a replacement rather than just using the backup until that runs out, too.

For example, keep a pack of coarse, 1-ply toilet paper tucked away somewhere. You won't want to use it, unless you *really* need it. When you do need it, you're glad to have it, but you'll still go out and get the good stuff.",getyourshittogether7,2,2025-05-01 14:02:09

I do not offer any explanations or guesses as to what it's a picture of. This keeps the child from getting discouraged that you couldn't tell their blob was a giraffe, and also lets you have a fun little convo with them. They're just small people and while they won't be able to articulate an art gallery style ""From the Artist"" blurb about it, they have their own thoughts and feelings about the art they make - be sure to ask about it :)

I use the phrase above quite literally, btw. My 5 yr old neice hands me a drawing and I saw ""Oh wow, look at this! I love it, it's so [insert descriptor like colorful, big, simple, has so many parts to it, etc]!!

I think it's a Bible quotation, but not sure. (I am not, myself, religious in any way whatsoever) 


It's definitely one I try to live by. 


To me, it means something like ""always be ready"".  I don't overeat, because i might need to run and dont want to feel sick. I don't get drunk, because my kid might call me in the middle of the night and need me to come pick her up from somewhere she doesnt feel safe. I try to stay ahead of work deadlines, not leaving stuff to the last minute, because there might be a last-minute emergency and I need to take a few personal days. You never know what the day will throw your way, you can only control how you respond to it, and what tools youll have at your disposal when you need them. Since you can't know it in advance, be ready for anything. ",Far_Tie614,1,2025-04-30 19:37:36

I passed numerous offers to make way more money than they were paying me, for less work. Finally gave them an ultimatum, they passed, and I found new employment. 

On the way out the door on my last day, the owner literally told me “when you fail there, you can come back and we’ll keep your desk warm for you”. It’s been over a year and my life is a lot easier with less responsibilities at work.",FriedEggScrambled,1,2025-04-30 19:38:48

Same goes for situations when a friend may overstep a boundary that irks me, but I’ve never discussed it with them, I’ll let said friend know my stance on the matter and that I’m not okay with it.  Okay, we move on. Then let’s say that we’re hanging out again and something happens and that same friend doesn’t do the exact thing we’d already discussed but the outcome of the situation ends the same as the first, I’ll discuss this with said friend again.

I traveled from my home Arhus/Denmark to LA/usa. 
Lo and behold some hostel rolmmate was same nationality as he bartender rhe last night of my stay (I was rhere for taking courses) and they knew eagh other and poured vodka on me. 
Despite 4 morningnalarms I woke up an hour later. Made it to LAX two hours before my flight. But post 9/11, even  it being 2014, that apparently wasn’t enough. No rerouting was possible. I paid for a last minute flight 16.000 DKK(roughly $2450). I made it home two says before what would be my mothers very last birthday. She had had cancer for over four years and it had progressed to her brain.. I hate thst I bought koccasins for my kother who had had hip surgery and couldnt walk. But she was always very happy for native american culture. To this day it still saddens me and weighs sown on my heart. 

Despite financial difficulties I dont regret paying that much for a transcontinental flight. 

I had budgetet the whole trip including flight tickets at around 14.000 dkk ($2100)


Even if buying a bike, laptop, car, theres always maintenance, insurance. Gadgets, spare tires etc that needs ro be bought. And yeah sure I might not have money for a new motor for that same car which usually makes up half- to a third of the cars real value.

When most people don’t like something or find it “just ok” they tend to not mention anything at all.  So when someone does give you a compliment they mean it. Take them at their word.

it also validates their feelings too :)",jammerpammerslammer,1,2025-04-30 20:04:12

I got into the habit in the AF with medical supplies. The supply room had everything in a specific place. In an emergency you don't have time to hunt anything; run in, grab a surgical pack, IVs and go back to the patient. Same with the medicine cabinet; If you need an epinephrine dose, stat, it's immediately available in it's exact spot.

I do the same with my studio; tubes of paint, brushes, canvas roll, stretcher bars ... everything has it's place. Sketch books, pencils, ink, stubs, tools, everything is in an old chest, each has its designated drawer.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpwjyye,"When you get a vehicle go buy a composition notebook.

1st page is what date you bought the vehicle and how much you spent on it.

Move a couple lines down and write the current year and how much it cost to plate it. This is where you track that yearly. It help you know how much you need to save up yearly for tags.

Next page you start logging your repairs.

It should look like this:
19,576.   Jiffy Lube. 1836 Beecher Ave, Long Island, NY          Oil change.    $28.94

24,832.   Mineke. 592637 Roy Ave Massapequa, NY
Front/back brakes and rotors.     $738.42

Etc.

You log everything. If you put air in the tires, you log it AND include what tire(s) were low.


In the book is also kept every single receipt from the mechanic. I also keep estimates that they print out for me.

When you sell the vehicle the book goes with it. 

I've only gotten a complaint about receiving the book once and it was a ""car guy"" who said that it was stupid to include and real car people don't keep track of repairs.",ifbevvixej,1,2025-04-30 20:35:05

My SO is always puzzled how I’m so quick with my morning routine, and the only secret is, I’m always doing everything the same way so I could do it in my sleep.

May sound like OCD but this is going to help me even more when I’m old and start forgetting things.

Where I live they will set up a cop standing in the road at a point where you have to slow way down due to a bridge and a turn as you come into town, just looking at people's inspection stickers and seat belts and whatnot. What they are really doing is having probable cause to stop people and then get a smell of the inside of their car, or just run the license and plates and see if any warrants come up. This was set up right outside my office window, and I'd see them arrest people all the time, so I asked the cops what they were doing arresting people out there and one told me that there is a high correlation between someone who will drive hopped up on meth with a car full of illegal shit or skipping out on a court date and not keeping your tags up to date or wearing seat belts.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpxjflj,"Talking to myself: ""if you don't do it, no one's gonna do it"" - especially when it comes to cleaning up, picking litter up and throw it into the trash, fixing small things etc.

Cleaning used kitchen gear right after using it, especially pans, because it's only getting harder once the fat gets crusty.

Putting knives with the blade down in the kitchen drying rack.

Never ever throw cigarette butts into the wild. (I took part in some riverside cleanup walks years ago and for no other item we bend down to pick it up more often as for cigarette butts. They will never dissolve)

Shower cold if I have good mood, shower warm if I have bad mood. Requires checking your mood every time you shower, which is a nice awareness / mindfulness practice.

If I want something, I will gonna ask for it. Because not asking equals getting it denied.

Everybody deserves a second chance. But no more.

No wooden stuff into the dishwasher. No pans. No sharp knives.

When mood is bad, try one of the following: shower, walk outside, music, workout / sports. 

When mood is bad because of other people around, I retreat and e.g. go for a walk with music. When someone retreats from me, I let them and give them time before talking again.

If I had an argument with loved ones, I will try to settle it before one of us is leaving.

When in doubt whether brushing teeth or not, brush teeth. In no potential universe brushing teeth is a bad idea (especially useful when drunk or high).

When I need a hug, I request it. When I feel someone needs a hug, I offer it. 

When I start some new class or sports and I do not like it right away, I will stick with it at least 2-3 months. I can still give up later. Sometimes it takes time to like something.

If I dress for a party, the inside layer is kinky / body-defining & the outside layer is cosy / body-concealing.

Drink a sip of water everytime before leaving a flat / house / apartment.

Switch off heat when opening a window.

Never trust car drivers when you want to cross the street. Most might be careful, some are not. I got hit by a car once, most traumatic accident I ever had. Now I only cross streets when there are no cars or the cars stopped. Just slowing down is not enough, as this was the case when they hit me.

If someone gets harassed, I will step in - ""if you don't do it, no one's gonna do it""",u1u7,1,2025-04-30 23:43:29

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpxoh1p,"Arguing is a lot of energy. And sometimes YOU need to accept that someone is just dead set on being wrong whether they know it or not, and they refuse to hear any opposing debate.

Take a step back and realize what you’re trying to do and what they’re trying to do during a disagreement. Are you trying to educate each other or just get the other to admit they are wrong? Is it a pride or ego thing? Is it based on objective facts, theory, anecdotal experiences? Can it be proven by more than “Well I heard…” and just REALLY wanting the words to be true? Sometimes it’s purely nonsensical and based solely on one’s loneliness and a desire for some form of social interaction, however toxic it may be. Sometimes they just want to feel like they won by getting the last word in.

Eventually you need to realize that neither of you will “win” the argument and you’re just wasting time and energy. There are many psychological tricks to defusing a situation once you understand what kind of person you’re dealing with.",Automatic-War-7658,1,2025-05-01 00:12:00

This keeps you as a mysterious coworker who was (hopefully) attractive and fun. Instead of someone who comes off like they have been hesitant to make a move for a year (or however long it takes). 

I've had this work out at least three times, that I can remember off the top of my head. I think it works because it feels more natural for her to gravitate towards someone once they've put in that initial effort, to get to know them.

I recall being really obsessive about an author, bought every magazine where he was interviewed, bought every book he wrote as soon as they were released. Then Twitter came along and he was one of a few famous people who completely turned me off to them because he had such abhorrent opinions. I somehow took the disappointment personally and it took a while to get over it. I have never allowed myself to develop a parasocial relationship again. 

Hardly anything is accomplished alone. For example, the years of the Civil Rights Movement wasn't just the work of the few people we learn about, it was accomplished by the work and participation of large groups of people, the vast vast vast majority of whom will never be named. You don't have to be perfect to affect change. See previous point, even, because a lot of heroes and leaders we attribute these movements to weren't perfect. Similarly, breakthroughs and inventions didn't just show up whole in someone's mind, most built upon previous attempts from others, information already available, collaboration. Do what you can. You don't have to change the entire landscape, just clearing the path a little bit is important work. 

Accommodate yourself, even if everyone else finds those accommodations silly.

You don't have to earn treats and indulgences, nor should you wait until the special occasion that might never come anyway to enjoy something expensive. It just as special to enjoy it just because you wanted to enjoy it.

It's never a waste of time or money or effort to try something and then realize it's not for you. Congratulate yourself for trying it.

Don't start any new task in the last 5-10 minutes of a shift. Every single time it will be deceptively simple until you realize it's complicated as hell and you will stay late. Every single time.",penny_reverential,1,2025-05-01 06:17:21

Never underestimate the benefit of cardiovascular exercise.  Not only is it good for your heart, but it's good for everything, even your mind.  You think more clearly, you have more energy, you feel less fatigued during the day, if you do enough of it, you never even desire a nap, your mood improves, everything improves.

Back in the Navy, I ran 4 miles in 30 minutes every other day on a treadmill.  If I skipped just one day, I would feel myself slipping a bit, becoming a tad slugging, tired, and unhappy.

It was very difficult to keep this up considering I was a boiler technician on an aircraft carrier and sleep deprivation was common and the desire to hit my rack right after watch was great, but when I take the time to do the cardio, I would become more rested with less sleep.",Single-Parfait-8691,1,2025-05-01 06:37:55

Reason I do this is because I use to have 100 different people in the company I worked at from upper management to labor workers who called frequently about what they needed, when I can do something, and what they should be doing.

Walk hacks

Walking is boring
- listen to an audio book. 
- listen to a podcast
- listen to music
- try a new route in a new neighborhood or park
- Call a friend. 
- My latest favorite: brainstorm convos with chatGPT
- take photos

Walking is lonely 
- find some friends to go with you
- take your pet (they also could use the walk)
- find walking groups on MeetUp
- call a friend
- the ChatGPT convo thing 

Walking is too easy 
- level up to hiking (the off-road version of walking)
- level up to jogging. Start in short intervals and then keep adding minutes. 

It is cold out - wear a jacket and gloves.
Raining - wear rain gear or bring umbrella. Some of my best walks and runs I had were in the rain
Snowing - be careful and dress warm. 
Too hot - bring lots of water. Bring a small towel. Wear a hat.

My feet hurt - get new shoes. Always spend on good shoes. If hiking, get good hiking shoes/boots.
My body hurts - get checked out or start figuring out why on your own. See if you can fix it so you can walk. If you can’t then how about biking or swimming? 

Try to say hi to those you pass while walking. Might brighten up their day and the simple “hi” back feels good as well. 

Tech
- wearables and apps are great for tracking health stats and location. 
- earbuds are great for entertainment and calls
- recently got the Meta Raybans and they are awesome for not only the above but to also take pics or video hands free. 

Do it enough that it becomes a habit. Durations? Doesn’t matter. Short and long have their benefits.

Now that I have decent money, I’ve devised a simple rule to stop myself from being unreasonably stingy with it. Whenever I think about if a convenience service is worth it, I think of it in terms on how much money I’m spending to save me how much time. Assuming m money spent and t time saved, if m/t is lower than what I earn at work per hour after taxes, I don’t even think about it further and just get that service, no further thinking allowed. This goes for travel, cleaning, house maintenance… could also be used for e.g. tools and gear.

I considered the fact that it is not my working time, it’s my free time, etc - it’s not about that. The reasoning is, that if time is a lot harder to manage than money, and if I’m _usually_ willing to spend 1 hour of my precious time on this Earth to put m or more money in my pocket, then I’m _most certainly_ willing to spend that m money to save 1 or more hour of my free time (which matters more to me than my work time) and I can just stop thinking about it and just do it.

As you get older and busier, it’s often harder to create new friendships, so it’s all the more important to work at maintaining your existing bonds with both friends and your family members (cousins, nephews, your great-aunt, etc.).

> Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding. By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to interrupt anyone else, and with better results than have been observed from merely thinking aloud without an audience.",Mithrawndo,15,2025-04-30 21:22:04

I’ve found that it helps keep me from internalizing things so that I can view things more objectively. Like “okay yes she has been annoying this week but she’s just asking questions bc this new assignment is kicking everyone’s asses and I’m glad she thinks I know my shit lmao”

I was fired, she stayed. Looking back, I realized that even though she would always roll her eyes or give the finger to our boss when she left, never once did she say ANYTHING less than complimentary in the presence of others and every text I sent complaining, she responded to with “I’m so sorry you are so upset” etc, but never ever put her own feelings into writing.",Blessmefatherusinned,2,2025-05-01 02:14:33

I (M) come at it from the perspective that men never get compliments, and a big part of that is because of how men GIVE compliments - often with undertones or insinuations of more expectations coming from it. So their assignment becomes giving a sincere compliment, and walking away, and then we discuss the reactions that they got.

Was at a brunch place once with a friend. The bartender had this AMAZING hair going on. Really bright fiery red, like her hair was set ablaze, intense color. I loved it. Said to my friend “watch this, I’m about to make someone day.”

Walked up to her, said “pardon me… your hair is fkn AMAZING! I am sitting way across the restaurant and saw your hair standing out and had to check it out and say something.” She smiled a real, sincere smile, thanked me and said she just had it done yesterday so she wasn’t sure how she felt about it. I said it looks awesome! And that was it. Continued to the bathroom. Not there to hit on her or anything, just a sincere compliment. 

Got back to the table and my friend said the bartender was absolutely beaming and telling the other staff working what I had said.

I have adhd and quickly realized in setting up my classroom that I would put down an item and it was as if I’d thrown it into a black hole, never to be seen again. Once I started following that quote, everything had a place, and would be returned to its spot when it wasn’t in use. And that system was/has been applied to my personal life and space as well.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpwq84f,"I was talking with my girlfriend about this just last night. There's a very obvious shortened version of my name. Think like Jacob to Jake (not my real name). But I prefer people call me Jacob. Except for my family. My brother and I work at the same company, and so sometimes newer coworkers hear my brother call me Jake, assume I prefer that name, and start calling me by it. When I explain the context and ask them to call me Jacob, 99% of the time it's no problem, maybe they accidentally call me Jake once or twice more, but they quickly correct that habit.

And then there's this one coworker. I've known him for years and he still calls me Jake. I've corrected him many times. It's gotten to the point that he'll greet me by the wrong name, and then before I even have a chance to correct him, he follows up with ""I know, you prefer Jacob, I just have a habit of shortening anyone's name like that."" It would literally be less effort for him to just call me by my preferred damn name and save himself the bullshit justification. It feels so incredibly disrespectful that I've genuinely come to dislike him as a person based solely on this. 

My girlfriend happens to have the same name as the girlfriend of a good friend of mine. Which has definitely never caused us any confusion at all! Except my girlfriend's name ends with -ey, while the friend's is spelled -ee. As I recall, I had only ever heard -ee's name spoken, the first time I ever saw it written out happened to be in a text I sent her boyfriend in which I spelled it -ey. My friend didn't actively call me out on it, but he spelled her name -ee in his response, and ever since then I've been very careful to spell them both right.

But there are the weird 10th person types who see the preferred name....but misspell it? Think writing ""Lizi"" instead of Lizzie.

A separate issue is people I work closely with and have had multiple meetings with who still can't get it right. I correct those people firmly because they 100% should know better. One woman literally called me ""Elizabeth"" whilst promising not to call me Elizabeth anymore lol.

I guess I should have said, there is an 11th type of person who knows about the preferred name, knows about the legal name...but asks which name I want to go by? Why do you think the preferred name exists? You think I made a preferred name, just to not go by it? lol.

On the afternoon of Sunday, October 8, 1989, the members of the McGraw and Léger families were participating in a hayride, travelling in a wagon pulled by a farm tractor, as well as two following pickup trucks, along the shoulder of Route 945. They were approximately 100 m (330 ft) from the end of the ride at a community hall in Cormier-Village where they had planned a family reunion as part of their celebration of Thanksgiving Weekend.

The driver of a tractor trailer (logging truck) hauling a 6-tonne load of hardwood logs cut into 20 ft (6.1 m) lengths lost control as he passed, resulting in the entire load of logs tipping onto the tractor/wagon and pickup trucks. 13 people were killed and 45 injured with many victims pinned and crushed; five children were among those who died.

Emergency responders from the RCMP in Shediac, volunteer fire fighters from Cap-Pelé and numerous ambulance paramedics from across Westmorland County responded. Victims were transported to tertiary care hospitals in Moncton, approximately 45 km (28 mi) away.",cheesecakeandsex,114,2025-04-30 19:16:33

Round 2: see if anything I saw would go good with anything else I saw.  
Round 3: make sure I have ingredients for stuff I saw and thought of making.

A 5 minute jaunt to the gas station should NOT require peeing first. You’re basically training your bladder to have zero tolerance for holding urine if you keep attempting to pee when you don’t have to. Trust me, break this habit. ",CalyKade,944,2025-04-30 20:02:40

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpxs5xd,"""never break the seal"" is a great rule for a lot of things. I've been around a lot of really addictive drugs and never got hooked because I never tried. I know I'd *love* heroin and meth, and probably crack, just from how I've responded to lesser drugs like weed and caffeine.

Same goes for gambling. It's a million times harder to quit/manage than it is to just not get into it.

There have been studies showing that basically, we only have a certain amount of energy every day for making tough decisions. Once you've made enough tough-but-correct decisions like ""Nah, I shouldn't eat that chocolate right now"", you get way more likely to make the easy-but-wrong choice.

When you don't ""break the seal"", you never have to make a decision in the moment of whether or not you're going to do the thing, so even if your decision-energy is depleted for that day, you're not gonna think ""fuck it, I'll just have *a little* heroin"". The easy choice is always just to do what you always do, which is NOT doing heroin.

Also, if you do get addicted to something, and you can't isolate yourself from triggers (like being around the thing you're addicted to), you can use up most of your decision-energy on just deciding whether or not to indulge on a moment-to-moment basis, so even if you DON'T give in to THAT temptation, it'll be a lot harder to not fall into other habits along the way, or to take any kind of positive action that breaks from your usual routine.",7URB0,8,2025-05-01 00:33:23

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpwsciz,"> If you dont want to do dishes, dont cook something that requires lots of dishes

This is the equivalent of ""work smarter not harder"", and I'm all for it.  Almost every dish I make can be made with a single pot or pan, a spatula, and maybe some pre-cooked rice.  Curry, egg sandwiches, pasta, stir fry, tacos, soups, tikka masala, burgers, fried rice, ramen, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some.

All single-dish meals, especially if you can eyeball the seasonings you use.  Combine this with ""Wipe down the kitchen while your water's boiling/sauce is simmering"", and I often leave the kitchen cleaner than when I enter it.

A boy my age told me that, and I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I felt creeped out and... betrayed, if that makes sense?

Anyway, that fear and horror certainly has stuck with me, and I can not picture a real person without feeling vile and nauseated. So I read fanfiction/imagine characters instead, haha.

I developed the friendships by chatting and if I clicked with someone I intentionally planned things for us to do, like go on a walk or go to coffee shop or a local show or something.

I started to make mental notes about which friends gossiped the most, and which ones the least. Two of my close friends stood out as people who almost never gossip. My life long best friend being one. My respect for them has been much higher since.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpyaa0u,"This may sound counterintuitive but something that might help is just allowing yourself to feel petty. I used to try to force positivity by lying to myself, saying ‘I don’t need to hate them’ ‘I don’t have a right to be this mad after so long’ or ‘It’s not even that big of a deal’ and all it lead to was me obsessing over it.

I’ve learned it’s okay to hate people. It’s okay to be mad about things that don’t matter to anyone else. Being angry about the things that hurt you is a way to emotionally defend yourself.

The real choice is what actions you take based on that. It’s a lot easier to think “I hate you but I’m going to be polite anyway because you’re a waste of time” than it is to convince yourself you want to be polite.

Most people get petty and angry when they don’t feel like their emotions matter. When you allow your emotions to matter, it becomes a lot easier to make choices separate from this.",NeonFraction,2,2025-05-01 02:18:33

I cannot imagine how much life must suck if you make eye contact with someone and immediately become convinced they're looking down at you, or if you read EVERY interaction as a slight against you. 

It must be SO exhausting. I couldn't imagine.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mq0mcqs,"With the whole attaching meaning thing...

The neurochemical process of any given emotion only lasts 90 seconds or less. If you can allow yourself to just sit with a negative  emotion instead of trying to justify it to yourself, you'll be much better off, and you won't get stuck in the shitty thought cycle (and thus persistent emotion).

*Kimmy Schmidt said you can survive anything for 5 seconds, and then you just restart for the next 5.*

This is the approach I take. I can survive sitting with my emotions for 90 seconds. If it's still there after, restart the clock. Just breathe through that shit.

Emotions exist to allow us to internally process stimuli; they're a natural and valid reaction. It's our own tendency to attach thought patterns to them that makes us suffer.

Seriously, 90 seconds. That's it. That's all it takes.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpyacyc,"I was conditioned out of giving compliments to women specifically because they will usually assume that it is not genuine. It was a hard lesson to learn that many people thought I was being a creep when I was honestly giving them compliments at face value, and I only realized it was happening because my coworkers at the time clued me into it. They spent enough time around me to eventually understand that I was being sincere, but shared that they found it unnerving at first and suggested that I should refrain from complimenting customers.

What's more is that they all mutually agreed that I must be gay because a straight man would never give genuine compliments like this. That gave me a lot to think about, and I never bothered to deny it because I was just happy at the time that my coworkers had become comfortable around me and didn't want to risk upsetting that. But it drove home the reality that I had been making people uncomfortable, and while I initially tried to change my approach to hopefully give a better impression and not have people jump to conclusions, eventually I had to accept that those societal assumptions just ran too deep. 

And I'm sure that's in large part due to that assumption being true more often than not. But my being genuine was not helping to buck that trend because I was almost always assumed to not be genuine anyway. I would rather just not risk making people uncomfortable, so now I will only ever compliment people who are already comfortable around me.",Myrsephone,2,2025-05-01 02:19:01

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpwo4m6,"I think there are a few things:


1) learning completely new names is hard. It's a bit like if I teach you the word for plot in Chinese, ""qíngjié"". Realistically, even if you say it a few times, you (at least, the vast majority of people) will forget it in a few minutes.


2) I find it particularly hard to remember names without knowing how to spell them. Not everyone's brain works like that, but that's how I remember things.


3) some languages/dialects just have less regular sounds. I watched an interesting video on why Brits find it hard to say ""Kamala"" – because it has quite an Americanised vowel tone, which doesn't come intuitively to Brits.


I make a huge effort with people's names (partly because I'm interested in different languages) but I appreciate it can be challenging for many people – just as when I visit China, I don't expect perfect (or even good) pronunciation of my Western name.",Intrepid_Button587,24,2025-04-30 20:55:01

Now, if you are reading it off a piece of paper and have never heard my name said out loud, I completely understand. I did the exact same thing your friend did with substitute teachers (some attempts were so bad that my classmates would yell my name with the correct pronunciation lol)

However, if you have only heard it said, and have not seen it written down, I do not understand where they get the idea to say it the wrong way. You have no idea how it's spelled, so why did you swap out an entire vowel??

M pet theory is this: Basically, there are two ways of looking at the person you're communicating with; You can think the person you're talking to is nice, and real with you. You'll interpret, and react to, everything they say based on that assumption. I call that benevolent communication.

And then there is number two: You think the other person is out to get you, trying to one-up you. And you interpret, and react to, everything they say based on *that* assumption. I call that malevolent communication.

My rule is to keep communicating with malevolent communicators to a minimum: Only if completely necessary, and even then, I go out of my way to be overly clear with what I mean. All they ever bring into talking is drama, anger and resentment.",The_Corvair,5,2025-05-01 09:20:01

Well I just barely manage to clock in on time and am going about my day when my coworker tries to call me out. I had put on my pants and then my socks. However, in my haste, I failed to realize that I had put the tops of my socks over the bottoms of my pants, and my coworker was attempting to bring attention to it. They found it humorous and attempted to belittle/demean me for my fashion faux pas. It was as they were making their attempt that they realized their folly. 

""What?! Do you put on your socks after...your pants...!"" 

I just kinda stared at them like ""yeah...""

And they realize their blunder and go ""yeah that makes sense, I also usually put on my socks after my pants..."".",SerCiddy,1,2025-05-01 02:59:26

I agree with you that it’s in no way disrespectful to stand up for yourself, your values, and/or other people under any circumstances, especially when it involves engaging someone with whom you’re familiar enough to be in their home.

E.g. last week I suggested a bathroom pit stop after school, before I dropped her off to an activity. We stop at a coffee shop not two minutes later because it’s on our way, and she orders coffee and asks for the bathroom code in the same breath. 

Me: “We just left the house two minutes ago, and drove three blocks”

Add some sliced turkey meat to the grilled cheese. Thin-slice some tomatoes and add them too. Or whatever else you like that goes with a grilled cheese (some dill pickle slices, onions, etc.). 

Make the sandwich alongside a bowl of steaming hot soup. Tomato soup, vegetable soup, noodle soup.

Slice up an apple or something to go with it. 

Have  big glass of water or hot tea or something too.

Just the other day I had some thawed chicken ready to go and had the makings for a caprese salad. So I seared the chicken on each side, had some seasonings to throw on it, slapped mozzarella on top and baked it, then put basil and cherry tomatoes on top with some balsamic glaze and olive oil.

Half the time I have it cleaned and put away before I even sit down to eat. Toaster oven has been really useful as well, and I'm pretty sure I got through my early 20s because of our microwave.

I find momentum really important when doing tasks like that. Doing it while you're moving is much easier than getting back up after you've sat down, hence me washing dishes before I've sat down to eat.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpyfe39,"Consent is not relevant or applicable when only one person is involved. You might as well say that playing Doom is murder.

No, these are things that are done TO another person, and they're wrong specifically because of their effects on the victims (and their families, etc). There's nothing wrong about shooting a gun at a person-shaped mass of meat and bone, it's the fact that said meat and bone houses a conscious entity who experiences suffering (or ceases experiencing altogether) due to that action.

Without the presence of harm to another, there is no moral wrong, and without the presence or involvement of another person, there is no consent or non-consent. Consent is a framework for interpersonal interactions, it has no more to do with one's private thoughts than it does with astrophysics.

You might make arguments as to whether it's healthy or not, but framing it as a crime against someone who is not present and utterly unaffected by it is absurd.",7URB0,5,2025-05-01 02:49:33

It is not being overworked, having a shitty memory, nor being too distracted, too stressed in general, and all the other common things that make people fail to check in on not only themselves but also other people.

Object permanence is a knowledge ability your brain develops: it's the ability to know that things don't cease to exist when you don't directly look at it. You merely forget about people and things, you don't think they cease to exist every time you blink or don't have them in your direct line of sight.

There is somewhat of a silver lining though.  He was a gay, black man who forever changed my mind as a straight, white man.  And I look forward to discussing him more with my son and raising him to accept everyone for how they are.

You can rebuild every one of them for $5 with a wrench and a Phillips screwdriver. It takes a couple minutes each. Also a good time to check if your main water valve actually works. That's how I found out my valve had a sheared stem. That would have sucked if the sinks started leaking one day! (I have a meter wrench though),beanmosheen,5,2025-05-01 00:59:48

He blew the motor because auto shop was shut down at our school during budget cuts that removed all skills learning electives. No one taught him anything. Anything at all. 

His parents never taught him the first thing about maintaining a car. Have never taught him anything at all, actually, zero knowledge or life skills imparted. Even though they were educated middle class people with plenty of knowledge to impart. 

It’s made for an unnecessarily difficult life. Since the MFer has severe adhd he refuses to acknowledge bcs when he was diagnosed his mother couldn’t bare HER son could EVER have a condition so it must be made up, he internalized that and has never once acknowledged or mitigated the symptoms. 

So. Ive had to reparent him for 20 years, which shifted the dynamic from partner to parent, along with the angst of “bucking the system” as the rejection sensitive dysphoria part of the adhd  that leads to internalizing ANY SORT OF IMPARTING WISDOM as a personal slight or insult which leads to the pathological demand avoidance

At first glance, I thought the name was a r/Tragedeigh, but kept reading and saw that it was an Irish name.

Reminds me of the time that we once had a patient here in Alaska with first name Siobhan. None of us knew how to pronounce it since it wasn't a commonly used name here. 

I quickly Googled it, let the doctor know, and she practiced pronouncing it a few times before she entered the patient's room. When she entered the room, she said the patient's name and still asked if that was correct, out of respect. 

After the visit, the Doctor expressed that they were happy with me getting the idea to check Google quickly before they entered the room. It helped to develop an immediate rapport between patient and doctor. 

Only took a few minutes, but made a lot of difference.

Edit:
Siobhan = shi / VAWN

Do you guys not... assign a sound to each letter? Like in most languages using the latin alphabet (or any alphabet for that matter, applies to the cyrillic and greek alphabets too), each letter makes 1-3 sounds. And you can... sound it out. Maybe you make it a short a instead of a long a and you mispronounce it because of that. But like, it still sounds kinda right. Maybe you pronounce a c as an s instead of a k. But like, it's still the right ballpark. And that's any language using the latin alphabet. 

Except irish. 

Oisin, pronounced Ohsheen. There's an extra i that you don't pronounce and a missing h that you do pronounce. How do you know how to pronounce that if you've never spoken Irish?

I can fumble through reading aloud spanish, romanian, german, italian, english, etc. My accent will be terrible, but my pronunciation will be right. 

But not irish. It's a phonetic alphabet that ignores that it's a phonetic alphabet. Why? How?",Sensitive-Chemical83,2,2025-05-01 00:17:21

I know that my ability to sense danger is over reactivate so I have to check things out more and not immediately take it as truth. There have been many many times it's right, but many many times it's wrong.",ThatGodDamnBitch,7,2025-04-30 22:10:34
"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpximro,"I missed a few police raids by listening to a little voice yelling ""LEAVE. NOW!""  Missed a fatal balcony collapse when that voice said ""MOVE"". Didn't get creamed by the speeding car with no headlights or the police chasing them because I heard ""FREEZE"" in my head. All before I was 25yo. Always with a friend or two who benefitted from the subconscious warning. 


I learned to listen. And as I have aged there are alleys and cars and paths I chose to skip with no regrets. Sometimes spooky things that might have happened to me were avoided.  I hope to learn the line between my intuition and my anxiety eventually. For now, sometimes luck comes with a little voice. ",tossaway78701,6,2025-04-30 23:38:59

If the call center's IT guy was lazy (I kinda was, tbh) then all possible failures would just go on the same not-a-human-so-don't-call list.  A good IT guy will probably schedule silence failures for earlier rotation back into active dialing, while fax machines will go years between calls, because fax lines rarely change these days.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpwms6p,"I apologize in advance for what turned out to be a long reply. 

People think I excessively hold but it turns out I just have a super human bladder. I've never had to go very often and always thought it was weird for other people to have to pee so much. Really annoying for road trips and such. Then I had a stroke 6 years ago and went for about half a day without peeing. Felt like I needed to a little bit the doctors and nurses were doing so many other things that I waited until I really had to go.

After fighting over not wanting them to cath me, I finally let them and began filling the 1000ml container she had. After I passed about 700ml she said I want slowing down, 800, uh someone go get another container, 900, guys hurry up he's still going, 1000 hastily switched to another container. Almost 1300ml later, I was done.

On, so maybe I just really had to pee? Nope. The 9 days I was in ICU I averaged between 800-900ml every time I urinated. I barely even fill the need to go at 400-600ml and if I'm doing the pp dance, it's over a 1000ml.

The only con at this point (I understand the possibility of weak bladder later on) is that it is embarrassing to go into an empty bathroom, start peeing, another person will come in, pee, stop and wash their hands, and leave while I'm still standing their peeing. Sometimes I can stand at the urinal while two people come and go if it's a busy bathroom. It took me 65 seconds of steady stream one day when I timed it (not including shaking and a few extra spurts. That's embarrassing.",Valreesio,6,2025-04-30 20:48:35

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpyfgq4,"The scanning of stuff tends to go the same speed but it's the switching between people and unloading\loading the carts that changes things up - if I'm remember it correctly. Like 50 items in one cart vs 10 items from 5 people ... the 50 items in one cart will go faster because there is only one load\unload and payment exchange. Something like that?

Maybe it's changed a bit now that cash\checks\coupon books are less common and swipe\tap to pay reduces some of that per person time. 

At Costco and Aldi (in USA) I definitely pick the fewer more loaded carts over the more smaller cart lines and they almost always are faster lines - those folks scan and load fast but people get all flustered with payments. :)",insomnic,3,2025-05-01 02:50:00

Similarly, Roman-a-clef fiction is real-life experience but shifted to a fictional character so the author can adjust facts and elements to make a better narrative.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpxwsf0,"Honestly, I've definitely taken financial hits from it before but it hasn't ruined me. I'm a writer, so I've never been super financially secure on my own, but I also grew up with a fairly verbally abusive family member so I just kind of internalized that as an adult protecting my own peace was THE big priority. I also grew up in a shitty part of Washington, DC during the tail end of the crack epidemic, so I kinda just made the determination that if worse came to worse I've been in the shit before and been fine, so I might as well keep my dignity. I'd rather be in a one-room hovel with my self-worth intact than in a nice house without it.

Thankfully it's not something I need to worry about anymore (married an attorney) but it's definitely a conversation that I had to have with myself when I started out, and honestly it would've still been worth it at five times the cost.

As for the realization, it mostly happened as them CALMING DOWN IMMEDIATELY, which was somehow more infuriating than if they had kept being assholes because it meant that they weren't blowing a gasket, they were CHOOSING to be degrading to someone who they thought was a captive audience. There was a lot of ""but but but we need this project done by (date)"" and the like, followed by insincere apologies, etc.

I wish I could say that I SURE TAUGHT THEM A LESSON, etc. but it was more an inconvenience: I do mostly customer and employee facing stuff like copy for websites, instructions, etc. so there was nothing super time sensitive or mission critical where they were just fucked and got their comeuppance.

One guy DID simply tell me to go fuck myself, which honestly I respect more than the backtracking",Crappler319,8,2025-05-01 01:00:02

I always say this. my reasoning is you can quickly resolve misunderstandings/questions/clarification over the phone. In my experience, texting or emailing is never that precise in actual practice anyways, and I absolutely hate the “email tag” that always happens. You ask a question, get a response the next day asking for clarification, respond to that a few hours later, then get a response to your original question a few days after that etc etc. What could be resolved in a 2 minute phone call is stretched over a week.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpydlf2,"Fair enough.  It also likely depends on the type of law.   Part of my practice used to involve a significant criminal practice and that is mostly a verbal practice.  

I now have an exclusive tort practice (product liability, hazmat exposure, etc).  Although there’s a lot of drafting involved, the attorney to attorney part is almost all verbal.  When discussing settlement or expectation, tone is as important as what is said and the written word is frequently too cold.  After the conversation there’s frequently an email to opposing counsel reiterating the understanding so it’s documented, but it’s usually brief.  

It’s also different because the tort bar in our state is a small world and you see the same people over and over again.  This leads to a rather collegial bar where there’s a lot of informal or off the record conversations.  

But if you’re in-house counsel or work in a M&A or contract firm I’m sure the written word is the preferred medium.",maltamur,1,2025-05-01 02:38:24

Also, Irish only began using the true Latin alphabet in the 1950s along with a spelling overhaul. Up until that point it had its own alphabet, so what you see written now is actually 'simplified' Irish spelling!",ponyparody,5,2025-05-01 08:29:59

When you're in life crisis, you're in hyper arousal and your brain isn't working right. When you get some of that under control you can really start peeling back layers of the onion. I didn't mean life is great, I meant that you can get to the real work of healing trauma and PTSD that resides in all of us. We're all just trying to escape the core problems of our youth that still exist inside us.

The shared notion of existence is suffering. Between life and death it is truly the sole shared experience of all humans, such that we should find empathy and connection in our attempt to appreciate the moments that lack suffering, and find tools to rectify and right ourselves once we fall or falter, as we always do.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpzq638,"It is *so* common for someone who becomes disabled to lose their friends, and that's tragic. I've never understood why people disappear and have tried to understand it. Not out of sympathy for those people — it's an absolute shit move — but just because I like feeling like I understand people's motives. I've come to the conclusion that it's part convenience and part ignorant denial, maybe? Sprinkled with a massive dose of individualism that US culture perpetuates. 

When you're disabled, you have to find work arounds that, ideally, loved ones will be patient with. But people are so conditioned to move fast, be ""efficient"", go go go, don't stop to take a breath, don't zoom out and realize it's actually fine if this task takes 3 minutes instead of 30 seconds. You can't drive? That is really difficult for you to navigate and I don't mean to minimize that. For you. But your friends? Just show up for a dinner and movie night. Who doesn't love a movie night?! 

The ignorant denial comes into play imo really often in our society. The way people treat disabled people, or even homeless people, with such dehumanization sometimes...I almost think it's a coping mechanism to seperate themselves from those they hope to never end up like. As long as they can ignore that their life might take a drastic turn they can just be on their merry way. I myself have been homeless, as well has some family, and we have varying levels of disability. The way some people will go out of their way to make eye contact with...someone in a wheelchair? 

There are so many ways to adapt and still be able to connect. Although maybe your ""friends"" aren't really trying to connect with each other in a genuine way. Many friend groups actually just have a good time, 100% positive vibes only, with not a single distressing thoughts amongst them. Pretty boring if you ask me. 

There's a reason why people from minority/oppressed groups often have many others like them for friends: they usually just get it. Are there any disability rights groups in your area? I'm so sorry you're experienced this. Losing a friend is difficult enough; losing a whole friend group can be devastating.",goddamn__goddamn,21,2025-05-01 09:45:55

If I respond in writing, I feel I can be precise while also responding relatively promptly. If I don't respond promptly, it's because I have other priorities.

tbh I tend to be suspicious of phone calls as either being an attempt to pressure me into a response when I don't have one (because if I did, I would have written it), or to talk to me when I don't have time to talk to you (because if I did, I would have responded already).",TH26,2,2025-05-01 03:10:52

As often as not, I might have honestly thought that what was being proposed by defence counsel in the verbal chat had some merit to it, but on reflection it didn't. Actually I think that conversations with the best advocates tend to be the biggest waste of time, because they're the most likely to convincingly suggest something that makes less sense on reflection. I just don't really know what the point is of a conversation where someone is trying to sweet talk me into something ""off the record"" when inevitably I'm going to want to sit down and look at it more closely before replying ""on the record"" anyway.

Autos have massively improved lifespans compared to a few decades ago. A 100k mile car these days is just getting to “middle age” as opposed to “at the end of its life”

Apple products have long lifetimes and extremely high resale value because of it. 

And while these Phoebus Cartel did indeed set a “maximum” lifespan for their members, they also set a minimum lifetime. They were a standards group setting a standard, and even when they were at their peak, long lifetime bulbs were still things that were sold, and even sold by their members. And it should put a huge damper on any “lightbulbs are engineered to fail early for profits” conspiracy thinking to notice that the Phoebus Cartel was defunct by the end of WW II, and while long lifetime bulbs were and continued to be a thing since then, the lifespan of the average bulb remained at ~1k hours.

That made me reflect on how I've changed since then, about 10 years ago. 

Weekly 1:1's where I continually asked for feedback on my work helped me, as did seeing them give me more responsibility when I asked for it because I love to learn. Then I started getting high profile stuff, that lead into group leadership (who are one step down from C-suite) and I started being asked to train others, I realized ""hey I'm pretty good at this stuff"". And then I started taking a soft leadership role, where people started coming to me first with questions, rather than their managers. When that started to happen, I realized not many people care that I'm autistic and I may put my foot in my mouth. Now I'm being actively groomed for a leadership role. 

That and therapy helped massively. Just having someone to bounce workplace interactions off of was a major help in and of itself.

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpx11go,"It's a symptom of being chronically online, if you ask me. Being online these days is all about getting mad at the next thing. Even better if it's some injustice right?

So the anger starts to feel like action, at least to the brain. A similar sentiment to ""don't share your goals with others"" because it makes the brain feel good just by doing that.

It would be real easy to fall into that mindset more often, the more you doomscroll and repeat this pattern.

Edit: It's fine to be online a lot, but awareness is key obviously. Lots of smart people can recognize the way the algorithm steers them. There's also a surprisingly amount of smart people that seem to be unaware of this manipulation.",Dear_Evan_Hansen,8,2025-04-30 22:00:43

""Nice dress"" could be a compliment, a cat call, a flirtation, an ice breaker, a threat... Women's lives all over the world depend on being able to tell the difference. It depends on context, and a woman who often hears ""Nice dress, you always look so well put together"" will have a different frame of reference than a woman who often hears ""Nice dress, bet it looks great on the floor"" or one who hears ""Nice dress but God will punish you with violence if you keep showing your ankles like that.""

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mq1qugt,"Oh yeah. Irish folks migrated mostly to Boston and the surrounding areas. 

Having lived in the NE, none of the people I knew had these Irish names, even the ones who decked themselves out and went all in on St Paddy's day, lol.

All of the folks who claim some bit of Irish descent had totally American names like John, Tom, Mike, Jessica, Ashley, Sally, or Sarah.

This is the first time I've seen many of the names in your comment. Other than Sean and Maeve, I couldn't even guess the pronunciation of the others. Even for those two, they're probably pronounced differently over there. 

Pronounced here: Sean = Shon and Maeve = Mayve 

How are those names pronounced over there?

Also, Alaska has been a melting pot for so many cultures and ethnicities. The Anchorage School District has over a hundred languages spoken by the kids.

For example, if they had been left to cry alone, they could have felt abandoned and lonely. Having someone there watching over but not intervening is a comforting presence like an emotional safety net, also is a practical presence, in that they could provide assistance in the form of actions or items if needed or wanted. 

It's like how a waiter at a restaurant isn't actually there at your table side waiting, and always actively servicing. They keep an eye on what you / your table in the case you indicate you want or need something.

Someone else might simply prefer to be alone while they get their feelings out. Then seek the presence of another person for comfort when they are ready.",YukinoRyu,11,2025-05-01 01:38:23

"What’s an oddly specific rule you follow in your life that nobody taught you, but you swear by it?",1kbo3ou,mpybjnl,"It's not. I'm a woman who has never had a child. I had chronic undiagnosed pelvic pain for 9 months with at least one doctor visit a week. I finally found a doctor who diagnosed me with pelvic floor disorder. 

She directed me to see a pelvic floor therapist. This therapist taught me core strength training, lots of stretching with deep breathing, bladder training, how to make my car seat more ergonomic, painful massages to break up fascia adhesions, and manual stretches of pelvic muscles from inside the vagina.

Over three months, I reduced my chronic pain from an 8.5/10 to nothing. Women and men from the '50s would have loved to have an evidence-based approach for these issues. It was, and is, a lot of work. But it worked. It's well documented now. 

The bladder training was just that you shouldn't pee more often than every two hours. Sometimes that's not an option, but just try to work towards that goal.

Edit:  it's not well known even though the information is out there. I only got my diagnosis after traveling 2.5 hours to a women's health center at a university teaching hospital. Mizzou, if you're curious.",fantastikalizm,13,2025-05-01 02:26:03

I was just making an off-the-cuff remark about the other side of planned obsolescence: profit. If anything, I meant for my comment to be a slight dig at capitalism, not engineers. I'm the latter by choice and trade, the former by birth into this hellscape.   
 
I'd like to reframe the discussion as follows: If manufacturers were somehow rewarded for the longevity of their products and minimizing waste, the products would be better for the consumer and planet.  

I don't feel like doing a deep dive on all three industries, but I'll share what came to mind.  

1) Apple intentionally slowed-down phones to boost sales of new models.

2) Light bulbs can be built to last 100 years, though I'm not sure about their electrical efficiency: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Light   

3) Purely opinion: I have a long personal history of buying Toyota Camrys with ~120k miles and driving them until the repair estimate exceeds the cost of a new-to-me one. I think car manufacturers could do more to prevent rust and make the various pieces more resistant to wear.

If it was a cheap builder-grade faucet, though, it might not be worth fixing, the easiest / best / cheapest thing sometimes is to just replace the entire faucet. Cheap ones aren't robust enough to stand up to disassembly and replacement of internal parts, and/or it might be a $40 faucet with gaskets that cost $32. But the good name-brand stuff can be disassembled and the replacement wear items can be ordered or purchased at an appliance repair place.

> Apple intentionally slowed-down phones to boost sales of new models.

Apple intentionally slowed-down phones to improve phone battery longevity for phones whose batteries were degraded. High discharge devices like a phone operating at full tilt can draw vastly more power than a degraded battery can reliably supply. This shows up to the end use as a battery reporting say 50% battery life and then suddenly shutting down without warning under load. When you have a degraded battery, you can get better run time out of it if you reduce the draw. Incidentally, your phone does this all the time every day when it reduces the clock speed of your phone when you're not using it for a high demand activity. Modern mobile devices don't run at full tilt unless they need to in order to maximize battery life. Apple's change was that phones with batteries below a certain capacity would clock down even lower and have a lower maximum cap. However, replacing the battery would restore the phone to full speed.

Apple absolutely screwed the pooch not giving the user good notifications about what was going on, mentioning only in the software release that they had changed power draw for low battery conditions. They also really f'ed up by not giving their repair people better training around the changes (they're famously tight lipped even internally, which more often than it should leads to the left hand not knowing what the right is doing).

But the key takeaway from all of this is Apple still does this to this very day. And so does every Android phone. iPhones will now display an alert for this condition, and has an option to toggle the speed reduction back off if you really want, but the default behavior remains and is common across the industry because it makes sense to do.

> Light bulbs can be built to last 100 years, though I'm not sure about their electrical efficiency:

This article (https://www.centennialbulb.org/docs/centennial%20bulb%20report.pdf) does some calculations and also has an ad from the time period for the bulb in question. Specifically the Centennial bulb is a 60W ""Shelby"" bulb. Brand new that bulb had an output of approximately 200 lumens (16 candlepower per the ad). Or roughly 3.3 lumens per watt. It currently produces according to the same document 0.17 lumens running at 4 watts, or now only 0.04 lumens per watt. By comparison, a modern soft white 60w bulb like this one from lowes (https://www.lowes.com/pd/GE-RELAX1-60-Watt-Dimmable-G40-Decorative-Incandescent-Light-Bulb/) will provide 720 lumens, for 12 lumens per watt. When new, it would have taken ~240 watts of Shelby bulbs to put out the equivalent light, and as it runs today you'd need a whopping 16.9k watts to reach the same output as a modern light bulb like people commonly used in their homes. Incidentally you can still buy 60w bulbs with brand new outputs in ~220 lumens, they're ""amber"" light bulbs but they're mostly decorative and you wouldn't want to use it to light your home. And if you ran one at 4 watts without turning it off or on, you probably could run one for 100 years too.

> I think car manufacturers could do more to prevent rust and make the various pieces more resistant to wear.

I agree they absolutely could, but that doesn't change the fact that they're so much better than they used to be. If this is ""planned obsolescence"" of cars, then in another 50 years we should expect our cars to last 500k miles or more with barely a thought.",omega884,8,2025-05-01 00:35:25

Looking at the sites now, 1TB Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is $2459CAD. 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max is $2349.

For comparison, the Redmagic 10 Pro ""gaming"" phone has similar specs, but 50% larger battery, double the ram(24GB), same 1TB storage, and costs $1500CAD. The cameras are probably worse than Apple and Samsung, and you miss out on the ecosystems(I do use Samsung Dex quite a lot), and other software features, but it's $1000 difference. 

I chose the gaming phone for the comparison because stuff marketed as ""gaming"" is often also marked up. Clearly, not so much as Samsung and Apple.

That and the asus rog phone 9 pro because I have an asus rog laptop and I'd love to be matchy matchy. 

But re:samsung being worse than apple, THANK YOU. I'm kinda neutral on apple, right now I have an iphone for work but I absolutely have more fun with androids. Pixel os, grapheneos, and nothing os are some of the cleanest crispest os' i've ever seen. Especially the haptics, the glyphs, and the little bounce animations the icons do in nothing os? Looove it. 

But I'm gonna throw out a hot take and say that Samsung fanboys (not specifically talking about you here because you actually recognize some of samsung's shortcomings) are now worse than apple fanboys. Samsung fanboys' sole reason for despising apple is because it's a popular brand with name recognition and people buy apple shit just because it's apple and because of the 'walled garden' that you'd think is the satan of software by how they demonize it. Like yeah apple's ecosystem is smooth and airtight but if you get one apple thing you're not legally obligated to get everything apple or else like tim cook will airdrop into your house and assassinate you. I use basically third party everything--apps, earbuds/headphones, laptop (obligatory i use arch btw moment). I have zero issues using third party shit on my iphone. 

I've had roughly equal amounts of time spent with samsung and apple and purely from a software standpoint I prefer apple by a longshot. ios has gotten much buggier than it used to be and the cracks are absolutely starting to show in the armor. But like I said earlier I far, far, far prefer pixel's flavor of android, or grapheneos, even nothingos, over samsung's android. Oneui is insanely bloated and has so much preinstalled bloatware that you can't remove without using adb, you get random notifications that are ads for samsung shit and shovelware games, the stock icons are kinda ugly and most of the galaxy store themes are also kinda ugly and look super dated (that's entirely just me being petty and shallow asf tho). 

Also nowdays you can't even root samsungs to get custom os' like you could back in the day. A huge part of the original pro-samsung anti-apple movement was because you could root samsungs (and other android phones) to flash custom roms and you could mod them in all kinds of crazy ways. Still can root pixels and nothing phones and basically every other flavor of android under the sun. But it's only samsung fanboys that are loudly anti-apple and also seem to think samsung is the only android phone in existence. 

And like you said samsung's flagships are comprable to iphones in price now, even the pixel flagships are starting to creep into that territory. But I think compared to iphone and samsung, lots of midrange android phones punch far above their weight. I got a pixel 7a secondhand for $150 to try out grapheneos and I love that thing so much I use it more than my iphone sometimes. I spent roughly the same on a nothing phone 1 to root it and install nethunter and again, sometimes I find myself reaching for it just because the software is so good. 

Idk maybe I just outed myself as an obnoxious pixel fangirl or a nothing fangirl. But I'll take it lol.",belf_priest,1,2025-05-01 05:00:36

The ones that didn’t show up or made my time worse, I stopped reaching out to.

Unsurprisingly they are the ones that message vapid vague messages like “I’m sorry for your loss, fuck cancer” after your dad dies, as opposed to the friends who actually show up to the funeral. The ones who message you to say “I’m here if you need but I’ll give you space”

May I suggest following your own advice? There's not a single question mark in either of your posts.

Well I know you're not an expert in the field or an engineer...

You want the TL;DR for the video? Fine. ""Longer life"" bulbs are just light bulbs designed for higher voltage run at lower voltage. They use more power to produce less light, and lower quality light. Light bulbs are such cheap, commodity products that they already cost less than the electricity to run them by a significant margin (https://www.energysage.com/electricity/house-watts/how-many-watts-does-a-light-bulb-use/), offering ""long life bulbs"" would simply be a scam that would increase the overall cost for the consumer who doesn't realize they're paying more. Lastly, long life bulbs *do* exist, they're sold as appliance bulbs and they're worse than regular bulbs in every way except for lasting longer. This is why lightbulbs don't last forever. It's not because people don't want a longer lasting bulb, it's because you *cannot make one* without tradeoffs that just make it a worse product.

EDIT: Oh and one last point, the person above already told you basically all these same things before you replied ""well I don't have a good response so I'm just going to ignore it and continue to claim the same things"". So that was two posts in a row totally ignoring what the person above you said. Not the behavior of someone posting in good faith or willing to have their worldview challenged. I felt insulted and disrespected being dismissed and accused of being a capitalist lackey for daring to question your worldview, hence my reply. Was I insulting? Yes, absolutely. Was it unwarranted? I don't think so, but I apologize anyway as I could've been more diplomatic despite you not being diplomatic at all.",VexingRaven,8,2025-05-01 00:22:30
